Okay. So, now um, last time. Can you uh push the button? One time please. So I'm still the secretary. Now uh, I ask you to presentate the prototype. One of your you two. Yes. The prototype. Well, thank you. Uh, now Yes. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. And the buttons? And the joystick is for the volume and the channels. Okay, so if joystick and L_C_D_. What's the R_R_ d Okay. Very good. So, we have So, what they say on the side is put fashion there. Yes. It's good. So, that's it. That's prototype. Now, the finance. We don't know if it's th it if it's okay. So, I'm gonna look. We have Sorry? Finance is um Yeah it's No, first uh Yes. We have to evaluate the product yet. Sorry. Criteria. No, it's okay. Oh, it's okay. What do you think? Yeah. Two. You? Me too. So it's a three. So it's a Yes, it's for the younger g group. So it's uh half half of the people. So I think it's four. No. Yes. So, I think it's four. Okay. Give it a four. Yep. We put the fashion in electronics. Uh, I say uh a five. It's not fashion, it's new. It must be a fashion. But it isn't. Yes. It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it. So, it must be a fashion. I think it's a five. No. Oh. I use my feet though. Okay. Well, I say three. So, counting then is two and a half. Okay, two. You? Me too. One. Next, six. It does not get lost easily. No, we did not. So, but can it get lost if it's such a thing? I don't think so. Yes. Not a not a normal shapes. So No. It won't get lost. So A one? Okay, a one. Next. Yeah me That was our target. Two. Yep. Right. There's a fancy look-and-feel. Okay. I say a two. It's a a bit personal. If it's fancy. So I think s two is better. No, it's new. Innovation.. Okay. Me too. Three. Yeah. Effort is three, ten and twelve. Thirty, forty, fifty,. Twenty one. So, it's uh two and three nine two and one third. Yep. Uh, nah. Okay. So, it's good. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Back to my uh Yep. Next please. So, now uh we have a product. Very happy. But uh, is it cheap enough? Um, so if uh I'll have a look. We have a battery. One battery. Okay, one battery. Electronics. Advanced chip. Yeah it's the most advanced. Chip-on-print. We have that one. We have the simple, regular and advanced. We have the adva advanced. 'Kay, so uncurved or flat. Nope. Single curved or double curved? We have double curved. So Then we have plastic, wood, rubber. we have half rubber, half plastic. No titanium. Special colour. Yes, yellow. Interface, push-button. Scroll-wheel, integrated scroll-wheel push push-button, or L_C_D_ display. So, we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels? Or one? And it's not really a s Yeah, it's this one. Now, uh button supplement. Special colour. We already Uh, that's the from the for the buttons. The buttons are regular colour. So, then uh then then then then then then Then Uh, no. It's too expensive. So, we have to change something. Fifteen Euros. Yeah, well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel, it's okay. 'Cause we can't lose the battery. We can't lose the advanced chip. We can't lose the double curve. We have rubber, special colour. Oh, no, we No, it's uh Sorry? Um, then we uh lose two Euros. Then we have thirteen Euros. Half a Euro too much. Exactly the special colours. So That's one Euro. So, I don't think that's good. Mm I think we have to keep the L_C_D_. If Yes. Then it's only thirteen Euros. So uh yeah. Yeah. Then you have Or you have to cut this off. Then it's not good anymore. So, wait. Okay. I'll have a look. We Yellow rubber. Yeah, normal. Uh One minute, please. Uh Is it maximum. Um Yeah, it's normal colour. But if you lose the joystick, it's still uh an advanced chip? Or it's then a regular? So, the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick. And what if we lose the L_C_D_? Yeah, regular chip. But Is it a good design? Mm, yes. Then it's okay. Okay, so no joystick. Oh no, but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro. Uh, yes, yes, yes, yes. No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour. Twelve and a half Euros. Then it's okay. So, we have to change that a little bit. And you cannot use the red and green button. Because if you give them a s uh colour, you have to pay point two Euros. Yes. Yes. So So Well Now we have to change that, but that's okay. Rubber. What's the normal colour? So And Where's? Yeah. So, now it's Yeah. It is. But then it will be just that ones. Now it's Very good. Now, uh project eva evaluation. Well What do you think of it? Uh About the project. Okay. And you. Okay. Okay. Well, what do I have to say. I think it was good. Not too many discussions. So, it's good for the speed. So, I think we're ready. Good price. Evaluation ready. Ready. That's it.
Oh this, you mean? Yes, well uh this is it. It's uh it's uh it's yellow. And uh, this is rubber. And and and this too. The the sides. And the rest is hard plastic. And uh We uh we had some uh We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside. And then it covers the these buttons until here or something. And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick. So, you can still operate uh all the things. Because you don't always use the menu. And then it can break. Uh, well uh Big buttons. And everything is blue, except the power button. And the mute. Of uh yeah, and the mute and the the other button. Yeah. Channel higher channel button. Uh, yes. Yes, that's uh Very obvious. Yeah. R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo. Uh, yes. Yes. That's about here. Oh. Three. Mm Mm, four. Yeah, but it's it's Yeah. I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons. So I mean, the colours are for young people, but older Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Yes. Two. Then make it th three.. Yes, a one. I like it. One. Yes. Yeah, but uh Yeah. Yeah. Yes, a one. Yeah, okay. Mm, three. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm, yes. Mm, yeah. Mm, yeah. Yeah. Okay. All the same uh Mm, yeah. Recognisable. Like what Yeah. Mm, yeah. Okay. Yeah, well the same. I I espe I especially uh liked the the means, the the SMARTboard and uh Yeah, it uh It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. No..
I don't care. Huh? Big.. Yes. Up is channel up. Down is channel down. To the right is volume up. To the left is volume down. The R_R_? I'll get it. I think the scroll-button is something also uh new. What uh not anoth uh, not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have. I think technologically I'll give it an seven. Si six six. Sorry, six. Oh, true or false. Oh, uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two. Sorry. Five. Mm-hmm. Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours. Four. Me too a two, because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard. But the rest of it is. So, I think a two. It it will be fashion. 'Kay. Three is okay. Oh, we'll wait outside. I give it a one. Say two. Two. One. Uh Just a small thing. Ah. Yellow. Looks like a pistol. Uh It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch. Uh Yeah, o one. Yeah. Me too. Two. Yeah? Yeah. I gave this a one because of the rubber. It feels soft. Uh, it looks like a l uh uh b uh, a bit like a joystick. It's Yeah. Yeah, f very fancy trendy. Two is okay.. Oh. I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round. Uh, the latest trends are soft things, you know, like uh I said in my presentation. Uh But the the colours are um basic, like yellow, red, um blue. Something what also younger people want. It's also a trend, so I'll give it a two. Two. Yeah, I think. Cheapest there is. Expensive. Well, it's the most advanced. Advanced. Uh, yellow. One. Joystick uh thing. We're not gonna make it. Yeah. Wh What what are the costs? Fifteen. A special colour. Uh, I don't think it's a very special colour. Yellow? Uh, is it a special colour? What? Yeah. And what if we use only one sort of um Um just only plastic or only rubber? One Euro discount. If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up, button down, button right, button left. And then we'll lose fifty cent in what? Uh uh-uh. No. And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour, wh No one will see it. Normal colour, and the the joystick away, and put the button up, button down, right, left. And it's twelve Euros, I think. No. Uh, no, no, no. Uh Oh, wait wait wait. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. If we lose the L_C_D_, then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_. Uh, yeah. Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television. And you don't have the L_C_D_. So, the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. No knew that. Yeah, then it's twelve Euro fifty, then it's okay. So, all the buttons has to have to be the same colour. But then the print on it will g um change it. Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is. Uh l How you call it? Recognisable, yeah. Yeah? Okay. Oh, well that's clear. And the joystick away. And its buttons. Yeah. About the process. Went good. Uh I think uh the creativity uh was good enough. We have a gun instead of a remote control. Um Uh leadership. Yeah, you were the project project manager, and uh had the final vote. So yeah that was clear. Team-work okay. Everybody uh has something uh to say about it. And uh no, uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult. But, nah. New ideas found. Nope. No. Yep. Beer. Yeah? Okay then.
This is it. Yes. Yeah. That's on the rub rubber part. Yeah? Alright. Do we Do we change the Do we change the the order? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first? Okay. That's uh um That can be none. Um, we gonna do the evaluation now, together. But I have uh a introduction how it works. So, it will come up. Uh-oh. Okay. Um, yeah. Well, we uh uh, I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias, uh based on um our marketing strategy, on uh the latest trends, on user preferences. Uh, we have a seven point scale from uh true, as well. To false, seven? And on base of each c uh criteria, we need to um give a rating. We can uh Well, it look like this. But we gonna uh do it here, they said. So, you hope found out how to do it with a Word document. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Um, well uh we have the Word document You So we open up that blank here. Um Think I can Uh, what this just an example. So, this not very important. But um, if I can get a number in here. Hmm. Well, uh we can't do that. Um, so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative. Uh, and then we have to uh agree on the rating together. And in the end, we will c uh count an average of all rating. The first uh on each item. Yeah, I think it's uh Uh, well technologically using, it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features. Only the L_C_D_. So, it Um, I think I will give it a yeah, yeah, yeah, a four. Hmm. So now i I think you uh see it um its statement. And you true or false. And true is one. So, yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. Um, well It's a one. The first item. So, okay the second item. Um, this product is for all sorts of customers. Well, it's a statement which uh I disagree with, because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow, it's not uh really aimed for all customers. It doesn't look like that. That's uh a six. Four. Uh, okay. Mm. That's uh the motto of our company. Yeah, well do we do this with uh this product? I um Yeah. I think if we do this, as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design. Um, so I would give it a two. Two. Uh Okay. Okay. Yes, I'll think of that too. Yeah, agree? A three. Yeah okay. The next element um is the product looks good. Well personally, I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow. So, I would give this a five. We have to do our uh Two or three? Two. Okay. So, well we gonna do the next part. Uh, yep. Uh uh, the next statement. It has not too much buttons. Um, yeah, I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better. And in the end we calculate an average. So, um that's why it's a negative in it. Um, well this one of our aims not have too much buttons. So, um uh did we uh do that? Well, uh if we go to uh this fashion, I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers. But you can you can go for that. And um that way, you don't have a lot of buttons over. So, I would give this a two. One. Um, but where where is the? So Yeah, did we implement uh the sound? Yeah. It won't. One. Okay, um well we aimed for the younger market. Uh yeah, did we achieve that. I think with the way it looks and um it is designed, I will give it a two. Yeah. Uh, yes. That that was uh, yeah, one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said. I didn't uh say it in my presentation. But um, well does it have that? I would say yes. So um Well, let's also give this a two. T Yeah. Okay. Two. And um, then the last one I could think of, uh it goes with the latest trends. If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people, and they ate uh fruit and vegetables, well it has a um a nice colour, uh well compared to food but we didn't uh We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that. So, I would did not give this uh a one or two. I We'll go for a three. Yes. A three. Okay. So um, come back to the presentation now. So, we find yourself there, and now we have to calculate an average rating. So, we will do that. Yes. By nine. Yeah. Um, uh okay. Two. Come on. So uh, that's a pretty low rating, I think. So, according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job. Oh. Nah. How am I doing? Yes. And I closed your slide-show. Which one was the last for you? Uh, dreaming. Next. Finance. Yeah. One... We would have uh n For a remote control. I've For a remote control, I think it is. If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick. For up down left right. The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it? If uh If we have the n no buttons If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons, we would have uh, we have thirteen Euros? And then uh we move the the colour. What will that be? Yeah. still, he waited at the No. Project. Yeah, I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices. I think um Well, the laptops if you have them out front of you, you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation. Um, well uh the draw-board, well you can draw things. But it not really going very convenient. Uh, maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there. And with a normal mouse. Um, and uh the project. Yeah, I agree on what was said uh mainly. Uh, yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others. And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking. To tell their opinion. Yeah. Okay.



@highlight

Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype .

@highlight

This is it .

@highlight

It's uh it's uh it's yellow .

@highlight

And uh , this is rubber .

@highlight

And and and this too .

@highlight

And the rest is hard plastic .

@highlight

the sides .

@highlight

We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .

@highlight

And then it covers the these buttons And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .

@highlight

So , you can still operate uh all the things .

@highlight

Because you don't always use the menu .

@highlight

And the buttons ?

@highlight

Big buttons .

@highlight

And everything is blue , except the power button .

@highlight

yeah , and the mute and the the other button .

@highlight

And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .

@highlight

Very obvious .

@highlight

Up is channel up .

@highlight

Down is channel down .

@highlight

To the right is volume up .

@highlight

To the left is volume down .

@highlight

Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ .

@highlight

What's the R_R_ R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .

@highlight

That's on the rub rubber part .

@highlight

So , what they say on the side is put fashion there .

@highlight

So , that's it .

@highlight

That's prototype .

@highlight

Now , the finance .

@highlight

Do we change the the order ?

@highlight

Finance is um first uh Yes .

@highlight

We have to evaluate the product yet .

@highlight

Sorry .

@highlight

Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together .

@highlight

I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences .

@highlight

Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well .

@highlight

To false , seven ?

@highlight

And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating .

@highlight

Um , well uh we have the Word document Uh , what this just an example .

@highlight

So , this not very important .

@highlight

But um , if I can get a number in here .

@highlight

Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative .

@highlight

Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together .

@highlight

And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating .

@highlight

Yeah , I think it's uh Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features .

@highlight

Um , I think I will give it a yeah , yeah , yeah , a four .

@highlight

I think the scroll-button is something also uh new .

@highlight

I think technologically I'll give it an seven .

@highlight

So now i I think you uh see it um its statement .

@highlight

And you true or false .

@highlight

Oh , true or false .

@highlight

Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .

@highlight

Two .

@highlight

It's a one .

@highlight

The first item .

@highlight

Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .

@highlight

Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers .

@highlight

That's uh a six .

@highlight

Mm , four .

@highlight

So I think it's four .

@highlight

I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .

@highlight

Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours .

@highlight

We put the fashion in electronics .

@highlight

Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ?

@highlight

I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design .

@highlight

Um , so I would give it a two .

@highlight

Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard .

@highlight

Uh , I say uh a five .

@highlight

It's not fashion , it's new .

@highlight

Then make it th three .

@highlight

The next element um is the product looks good .

@highlight

Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow .

@highlight

So , I would give this a five .

@highlight

I give it a one .

@highlight

Well , I say three .

@highlight

Uh uh , the next statement .

@highlight

It has not too much buttons .

@highlight

I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better .

@highlight

Well , uh if we go to uh this fashion , I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers .

@highlight

So , I would give this a two .

@highlight

One .

@highlight

Me too .

@highlight

One .

@highlight

It does not get lost easily .

@highlight

Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?

@highlight

Yes .

@highlight

No , we did not .

@highlight

So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ?

@highlight

Ah .

@highlight

Yellow .

@highlight

I don't think so .

@highlight

It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .

@highlight

A one ?

@highlight

Yeah , o one .

@highlight

Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .

@highlight

Uh yeah , did we achieve that .

@highlight

I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .

@highlight

There's a fancy look-and-feel .

@highlight

That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said .

@highlight

Well , let's also give this a two .

@highlight

I gave this a one because of the rubber .

@highlight

Yeah , f very fancy trendy .

@highlight

It's a a bit personal .

@highlight

If it's fancy .

@highlight

So I think s two is better .

@highlight

uh it goes with the latest trends .

@highlight

No , it's new .

@highlight

Innovation .

@highlight

If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .

@highlight

We'll go for a three .

@highlight

I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round .

@highlight

But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue .

@highlight

Something what also younger people want .

@highlight

Two .

@highlight

So um , come back to the presentation now .

@highlight

So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating .

@highlight

Effort is three , ten and twelve .

@highlight

Thirty , forty , fifty , .

@highlight

Twenty one .

@highlight

So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .

@highlight

So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .

@highlight

So , it's good .

@highlight

So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job .

@highlight

Next .

@highlight

Finance .

@highlight

So , now uh we have a product .

@highlight

But uh , is it cheap enough ?

@highlight

We have a battery .

@highlight

Cheapest there is .

@highlight

Electronics .

@highlight

Advanced chip .

@highlight

it's the most advanced .

@highlight

We have the simple , regular and advanced .

@highlight

We have the adva advanced .

@highlight

We have double curved .

@highlight

we have half rubber , half plastic .

@highlight

Special colour .

@highlight

Yes , yellow .

@highlight

So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ?

@highlight

Or one ?

@highlight

One .

@highlight

And it's not really a s Joystick uh thing .

@highlight

Now , uh button supplement .

@highlight

Special colour .

@highlight

The buttons are regular colour .

@highlight

It's too expensive .

@highlight

Fifteen Euros .

@highlight

So , we have to change something .

@highlight

well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay .

@highlight

'Cause we can't lose the battery .

@highlight

We can't lose the advanced chip .

@highlight

We can't lose the double curve .

@highlight

We have rubber , special colour .

@highlight

Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .

@highlight

Yellow ?

@highlight

Uh , is it a special colour ?

@highlight

For a remote control , I think it is .

@highlight

If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick .

@highlight

For up down left right .

@highlight

Um , then we uh lose two Euros .

@highlight

Then we have thirteen Euros .

@highlight

Exactly the special colours .

@highlight

Half a Euro too much .

@highlight

Um just only plastic or only rubber ?

@highlight

One Euro discount .

@highlight

I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ .

@highlight

And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour Normal colour , and the the joystick away , But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?

@highlight

Or it's then a regular ?

@highlight

The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .

@highlight

Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television .

@highlight

And then uh we move the the colour .

@highlight

No joystick .

@highlight

Push-buttons .

@highlight

No special colour .

@highlight

And you cannot use the red and green button .

@highlight

So , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour .

@highlight

What's the normal colour ?

@highlight

Very good .

@highlight

Now , uh project eva evaluation .

@highlight

process .

@highlight

Went good .

@highlight

I think uh the creativity uh was good enough .

@highlight

Uh leadership .

@highlight

Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .

@highlight

Team-work okay .

@highlight

New ideas found .

@highlight

Nope .

@highlight

I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices .

@highlight

Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation .

@highlight

Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things .

@highlight

But it not really going very convenient .

@highlight

Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor Um , and uh the project .

@highlight

Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly .

@highlight

Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others .

@highlight

And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking .

@highlight

I think it was good .

@highlight

Not too many discussions .

@highlight

So , it's good for the speed .

@highlight

So , I think we're ready .

@highlight

Good price .

@highlight

Evaluation ready .
