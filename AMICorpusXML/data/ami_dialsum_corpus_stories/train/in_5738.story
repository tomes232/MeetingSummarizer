um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . <EOS> okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . <EOS> um i think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . <EOS> but i think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , <EOS> so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and <EOS> whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . <EOS> um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . <EOS> we brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . <EOS> and manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . <EOS> we need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , <EOS> which i think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . <EOS> um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . <EOS> yeah . yeah . right . <EOS> or with exterior designs . <EOS> but my question is , i mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , <EOS> and i'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . <EOS> so maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , <EOS> or i don't know , different options for female , male target groups . <EOS>
