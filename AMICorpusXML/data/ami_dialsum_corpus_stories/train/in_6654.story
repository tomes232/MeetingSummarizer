give it a little bit . <EOS> oh <EOS> there we go . perfect . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> this is me . <EOS> um basically <EOS> i was looking through some marketing reports that we've got <EOS> and we had a usability test <EOS> where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use t_v_ remotes <EOS> and see what it is that they're using <EOS> and then they filled out a questionnaire <EOS> about what they like and what they don't about their general t_v_ remote control practices . <EOS> um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , <EOS> m <EOS> the majority of the time that's all that's going on , <EOS> the other functions happen , <EOS> for some people they're important , <EOS> but the primary uses are really really basic . <EOS> um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , <EOS> they're not using a lot of it , <EOS> they don't need it , <EOS> they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . <EOS> and um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . and then they can't find it in the room . <EOS> so i think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . <EOS> um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , <EOS> and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , <EOS> and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . <EOS> i don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , <EOS> that's up to the design people , <EOS> but it is s something worth thinking about , <EOS> especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , <EOS> so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . <EOS> um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are <EOS>
