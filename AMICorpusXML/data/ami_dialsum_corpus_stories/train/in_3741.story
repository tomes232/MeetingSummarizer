the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . <EOS> um and and then we'll <EOS> as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out , <EOS> and we have uh forty minutes to do this in <EOS> and i uh <EOS> anyway . okay . now , <EOS> the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . <EOS> um and and they want it only to cover televisions . <EOS> um now , <EOS> what is not q quite clear from their directive is <EOS> whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext <EOS> or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , d_v_d_s , um satellite boxes , <EOS> which uh i mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . <EOS> the um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . <EOS> um and on that basis um i i think we we need to bear that in mind , <EOS> um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . <EOS> um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . <EOS> um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two r_s in grey against uh a yellow background . <EOS> um now <EOS> this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . <EOS> but uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . <EOS> um it also has to be simple , <EOS> which to some extent goes along w with the first one , <EOS> and that we've already said that it must be simple <EOS> 'cause that's what people want anyway . <EOS> um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , <EOS> which um mm uh is is is their choice , <EOS> but uh um we we need to talk that through . <EOS> um okay , so uh <EOS> after the meeting it'll be summarised <EOS> and uh <EOS>
