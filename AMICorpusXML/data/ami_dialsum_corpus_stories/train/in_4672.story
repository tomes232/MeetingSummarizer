this is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see . <EOS> so if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow l_c_d_ display . <EOS> um , this is actually hard to do . <EOS> the yellow button you have is the on off button , <EOS> so it's really big , hard to miss . <EOS> you have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . <EOS> so up volume up , down volume down . <EOS> the green are the channel changing . <EOS> s and it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . <EOS> and then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , <EOS> and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the t_v_ , <EOS> and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . <EOS> so this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time . <EOS>
