mm . <EOS> oh i think forget about the mirror <EOS> that was just a very quick passing thought yeah . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> okay , uh <EOS> would like to share something which i did here . <EOS> first thing is uh basically on design <EOS> we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . <EOS> second is we checked into competitors , <EOS> the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . <EOS> so y you generally see there's not much of variety <EOS> and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . <EOS> so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . <EOS>
