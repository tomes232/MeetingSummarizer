okay , um <EOS> obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , <EOS> we reviewed the previous minutes before that , <EOS> um each of you made your presentations . <EOS> um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . <EOS> the market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . <EOS> um we decided chip on print would be used . <EOS> um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , i think was the consensus , <EOS> powered by kinetic energy . <EOS> there was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . <EOS> um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . <EOS> um looking like a scroll , <EOS> but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , <EOS> that is uh behind the scenes is push button <EOS> which we uh according to kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . <EOS> um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product <EOS> that could be suggested to management . <EOS> um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . <EOS> um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits <EOS> and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints <EOS> and we ran out of time . <EOS> um we had to follow that up <EOS> and prepare for the last one . <EOS> and uh we closed <EOS> as it ran out of time . <EOS> is that a fair presentation of what happened ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> back to this meeting . <EOS> um we're down to the prototype presentation . <EOS>
