okay . <EOS> about the components design . <EOS> um for the energy source we can use a basic battery <EOS> or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , <EOS> which you just shake and it produces energy . <EOS> but if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . <EOS> so i don't think it's really an option . <EOS> uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . <EOS> it's really up the the design that we're gonna use . <EOS> it's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . <EOS> uh as a case supplement , we could um , i thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . <EOS> uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . <EOS> and the chip-set , um it says simple here , <EOS> but it should be advanced , <EOS> because we're using an l_c_d_ uh screen . <EOS> and as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , <EOS> but it raises the price <EOS> and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . <EOS> form should follow function overall . <EOS> um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . <EOS> but depends on what we want . <EOS> i think we should disc discuss that . <EOS> um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . <EOS> and the chip-set uh really should be advanced <EOS> because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . <EOS> and that's it . <EOS>
