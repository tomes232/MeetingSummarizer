we don't have a lot of time left <EOS> and we will still have to make a decision , <EOS> and the marketing expert has to present her her thing . <EOS> okay . <EOS> go right to my first my next slide . <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> um alright , my method is uh i'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , <EOS> so i've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . <EOS> i s i spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . <EOS> and then when i'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , <EOS> and if it's convenient in the conversation i ask about it . <EOS> and i would encourage you all to do the same . <EOS> um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . <EOS> um people like something that really fits in their hand . <EOS> simple is beautiful . <EOS> they don't want to have to squint at small print um , <EOS> they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , <EOS> and they don't care for the mode thing . <EOS> they want each button to do something . <EOS> and eye-catching is important . <EOS> it's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . <EOS> go ahead , <EOS> i'm trying to finish fast for you . <EOS> um and our preference is , as far as i'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . <EOS> ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , <EOS> so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item . <EOS> and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . <EOS> if we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . <EOS> so we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , i think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . <EOS> and i've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular . <EOS> and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . <EOS> and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . <EOS> they are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . <EOS> so those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item . <EOS>
