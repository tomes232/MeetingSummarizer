and , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . <EOS> we have to have as few buttons as possible , <EOS> because more buttons is more confusion , <EOS> so that's why i'm saying , simplicity is good . <EOS> finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . <EOS> so we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , <EOS> and i've already said this several times but i put it down in writing here , <EOS> it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . <EOS> so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five euros i'm not gonna take that . <EOS> has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five euros isn't much . <EOS> um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . <EOS> okay that's uh about it for me right now . <EOS>
