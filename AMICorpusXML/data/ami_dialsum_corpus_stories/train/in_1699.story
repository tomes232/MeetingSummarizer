so , i mean there are <EOS> there are uh cheaper <EOS> this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , <EOS> there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . <EOS> so this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , <EOS> because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on epinions . <EOS> it it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible <EOS> um because really i think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . <EOS> and was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , <EOS> but i think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . <EOS> so if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want . <EOS> so <EOS>
