hmm . <EOS> so , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for <EOS> very specifically what it would be used for , <EOS> 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , <EOS>
