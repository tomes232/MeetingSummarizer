okay we all all set ? <EOS> right . <EOS> well this is the uh final detailed design meeting . <EOS> um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . <EOS> and the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , <EOS> like absolute final decision , <EOS> um and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . <EOS> so um <EOS> just from from last time to recap , <EOS> we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no l_c_d_ display , no need for talk-back , <EOS> it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , <EOS> maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , <EOS> um hopefully a jog-dial , <EOS> and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . <EOS> anything i've missed ? <EOS> okay <EOS> um so uh <EOS> if you want to present your prototype go ahead . <EOS>
