yeah . <EOS> um , i haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . <EOS> so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v_ <EOS> to make make it as simple as possible . <EOS> and to summarise i i would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button <EOS> because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons <EOS> and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . <EOS> but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , <EOS> will this two features together . <EOS> so what the concept is to have a flip-top model . the <EOS> main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top <EOS> and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . <EOS> so it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience <EOS> and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body <EOS> and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . <EOS> findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls <EOS> because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons <EOS> so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . <EOS> as we saw we we have to make a profit also <EOS> so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production <EOS> mm by fifty million we said ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> with that i think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , <EOS> so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . <EOS>
