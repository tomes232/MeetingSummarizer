yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but when all the questions i had <EOS> do we want to use uh a menu display on the t_v_ ? <EOS> or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? <EOS> 'cause if you use a memory display on the t_v_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . <EOS> uh so <EOS> that's my recommendation , <EOS> if you use many options in one buttle button , um display the menu on the t_v_ <EOS> and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , <EOS> is too complicated for most users . <EOS>
