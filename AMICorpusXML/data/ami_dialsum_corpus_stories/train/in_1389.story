y probably not yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> which also makes a base station basically obsolete . <EOS> we don't need that then . <EOS> um <EOS> however <EOS> our interface options are push-buttons . <EOS> in which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . <EOS> um <EOS> however we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . <EOS> and they are possible . <EOS> we have an okay for scroll wheels . <EOS> okay . um <EOS> however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l_c_d_ into the remote control as well . <EOS> this however may exclude certain um materials . <EOS> if you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an l_c_d_ screen may be affected by the movement . <EOS> hence we might not be able to put it in there . <EOS> so um <EOS> there's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . <EOS> if we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that i've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . <EOS> i don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . <EOS> i'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , <EOS> but that's not up to me to decide really . <EOS> so that's for the for the scroll wheel . <EOS> um it limits our choice <EOS> and squishy is hip , so i'd say rather not go for for that . <EOS> let's see now . <EOS> um um <EOS> solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . <EOS> but obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , i assume <EOS> right ? <EOS> or is anybody still <EOS> alright . <EOS>
