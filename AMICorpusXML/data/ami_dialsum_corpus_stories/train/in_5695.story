since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . <EOS> this energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself . <EOS> uh which can be buttons , whatever , <EOS> which in fact controls a chip . <EOS> right ? <EOS> this is the user interface <EOS> and there we have the chip . <EOS> um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . <EOS> that sends out the signal . <EOS> of course the signal differs accordingly . um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . <EOS> and of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . <EOS> the way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , <EOS> so that you know that it's working basically . <EOS> you press something , you get a response . <EOS> which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . <EOS> now this , <EOS> what we're talking about here , or what i think should be discussed are these two components mostly . <EOS> the the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . <EOS> what we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . <EOS> we cannot change the chip <EOS> which controls the infrared lamp . <EOS> right ? <EOS> these two are components that we have to use , <EOS> and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . <EOS> um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . <EOS> it c it doesn't have to be there . <EOS> this can be discussed as well . <EOS> the user interface . that's something we can also discuss . <EOS> um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . <EOS> speech recognition um interface , <EOS> we don't know that . <EOS> or if we just do the usual button thing . <EOS> or we have a touch pad or something like that <EOS> that's something we can discuss . <EOS> and of course the energy source . batteries . solar cells . <EOS> who knows ? <EOS>
