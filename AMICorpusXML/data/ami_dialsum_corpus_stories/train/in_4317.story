it's only a t_v_ . <EOS> or from from my perspective i think l_c_d_ is a mistake <EOS> because this is a universal remote <EOS> and all you're doing i mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , <EOS> so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last <EOS> and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there . <EOS> it receives no information . <EOS>
