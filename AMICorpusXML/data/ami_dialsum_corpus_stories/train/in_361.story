interesting question . <EOS> 's a bit of a challenge question . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well <EOS> i'd say shop around <EOS> but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right , that's my concern too . <EOS> um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . <EOS> my personal preference is <EOS> i'll just throw my cards on the table , <EOS> uh i think we should probably go the solar battery route , <EOS> just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . <EOS> uh , i like the idea of the visible light signalling , <EOS> that's something to set us apart <EOS> and uh i was thinking about i was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . <EOS> so we're not so confined by one style <EOS> and say some you know , say our the one <EOS> if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation . <EOS>
