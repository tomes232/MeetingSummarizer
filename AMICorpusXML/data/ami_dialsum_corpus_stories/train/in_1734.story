well , <EOS> one thing i'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l_c_d_ remotes <EOS> that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , <EOS> so you get the sort of you get um you <EOS> you can redesign the interface to your own needs , <EOS> you can programme in macros , <EOS> and you get a much greater degree <EOS> um um i mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , <EOS> but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , <EOS> and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the t_v_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the v_c_r_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . <EOS> um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . <EOS> and therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . <EOS>
