um we could use solar cells . <EOS> or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . <EOS> such as like watches you know . where you just move them <EOS> m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . <EOS> so um obviously i personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . <EOS> you don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it <EOS> right ? <EOS> um solar cell is interesting . <EOS> may fail though , every here and there . <EOS>
