well <EOS> at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , <EOS> so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five euro by itself . <EOS> right . <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> the only break-down that i was given in terms of age was the voice activation <EOS> and basically there's a big jump , <EOS> after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , <EOS> so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . <EOS> i dunno i'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , <EOS> but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range . <EOS>
