um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . <EOS> sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a v_ for volume . <EOS> just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . <EOS> um i think , d carrying on from what i've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . <EOS> maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , <EOS> you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . <EOS> and then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . <EOS> um i don't <EOS> it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an ipod where you just sort of control through the menus . <EOS> stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . <EOS> and then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . <EOS>
