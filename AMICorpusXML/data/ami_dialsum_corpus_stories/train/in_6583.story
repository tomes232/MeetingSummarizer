well , it's a bit difficult to say , <EOS> because um in fact we have some constraints in terms of furniture . <EOS> uh they are here . <EOS> so um well , your your person your your question actually is answered maybe by the third item . <EOS> so each person should get um , well , it's a sort of desk , <EOS> it's made of two pieces <EOS> and it looks like a corner . <EOS> with , of course , a chair . <EOS> uh a filing cabinet that goes under the desk uh <EOS> and , well , we can put hanging shelves over the the desks . <EOS> so i'm not really sure it's possible to get three um three desks in a two person office . <EOS> but um we could try . <EOS> what's what should be said here , <EOS> i don't know if , well , you <EOS> i i will maybe distribute now documents if you don't have them . <EOS> maybe it's easier . <EOS> do you need something , martin ? <EOS> um , i can keep this for you . <EOS> uh so it's it's <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you have a copy , susan . <EOS> you too david , i think . <EOS> so in fact there are more places than people , <EOS> so we won't be that constrained . <EOS> uh as you know some of us and some of you here actually , martin and david are part-time . <EOS> so it it's for the moment quite comfortable . <EOS> normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for , you know , temporary people coming to work on uh on projects . <EOS> uh yeah , i uh yeah , <EOS> i counted so we have um fifteen pers physical persons <EOS> and about uh sixteen , i think , uh persons oh , actually , eighteen persons in the offices . <EOS>
