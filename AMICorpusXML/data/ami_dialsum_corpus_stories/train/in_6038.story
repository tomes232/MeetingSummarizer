hmm . <EOS> interesting . <EOS> that would be amazing , though , yeah . <EOS> no , splinters would <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um certain restrictions do apply here though . <EOS> uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . <EOS> so , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . <EOS> double-curved , you can't do titanium . <EOS> um that would be two curvatures , <EOS> so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . <EOS> now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . <EOS> and uh so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . <EOS> i think i have one more slide . <EOS> no , i didn't . <EOS>
