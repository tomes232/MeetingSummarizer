okay . <EOS> so , either <EOS> i dunno <EOS> we just need to decide on the on the case . <EOS> let's have rubber push buttons , hey . <EOS> okay . <EOS> go rubber . go rubber the whole way . <EOS> let's go crazy . <EOS> and then , do i have a last slide ? <EOS> yes , i do . <EOS> um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be <EOS> so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . <EOS> um and the price that go with it with it , <EOS> so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . <EOS> uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . <EOS> if we get an advanced chip which is um used for the l_c_d_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . <EOS>
