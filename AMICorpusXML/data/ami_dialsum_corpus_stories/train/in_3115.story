oh . should be in there . well , <EOS> i can tell you them uh from my laptop . <EOS> um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . <EOS> so that's uh the first thing we i think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . <EOS> uh the remote control should only be used for the television , <EOS> otherwise the project becomes more complex , <EOS> which endangers the time to market , <EOS> and of course would make it more costly , i think . <EOS> um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , <EOS> and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , <EOS> and you talked about that before . <EOS> and uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , <EOS> which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . <EOS> so we have to keep that in mind . <EOS>
