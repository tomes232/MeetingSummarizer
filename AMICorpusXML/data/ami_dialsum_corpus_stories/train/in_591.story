uh l_c_d_ screen as in uh touch screen ? <EOS> yeah , touch screen , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . <EOS> because they use the remote control often more often , <EOS> and are more technical than the ol older people . <EOS> and the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . <EOS> so we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , <EOS> but also somewhat on the elderly people . <EOS> and on my personal preferences , i don't have any mo more time to come with that , <EOS> but like i said , l_c_d_ screen is easily to use <EOS> because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . <EOS>
