so , <EOS> let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . <EOS> it's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . <EOS> and the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface <EOS> and <EOS> which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit <EOS> that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses , <EOS> we turn that into a message , <EOS> um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . <EOS> now <EOS> i would have hoped <EOS> i think that's my only slide actually , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i would have have hoped to um do you a pretty powerpoint slide of um my first cut design , <EOS> but unfortunately the technology defeated me , <EOS> so if you'll bear with me i'll do it on the whiteboard . <EOS> so <EOS> we want an energy source <EOS> which is there . <EOS> and we've got to think about what that might be . <EOS> uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . <EOS> uh typically it would be a battery , <EOS> but i'm open to suggestions . <EOS> um and <EOS>
