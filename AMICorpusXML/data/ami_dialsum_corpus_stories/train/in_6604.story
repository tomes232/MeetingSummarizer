got it . <EOS> yeah . th that looks like it . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so basic remote operation runs as follows , <EOS> press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , <EOS> chip senses the connection , <EOS> chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . <EOS> so you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . <EOS> transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the t_v_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . <EOS> so that being said <EOS> next slide , please . <EOS> findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , <EOS> so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , <EOS> we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , <EOS> all those basic things that make a circuit function . <EOS> um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . <EOS> an l_e_d_ , which is a light emitting diode , <EOS> um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , <EOS> whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . <EOS> next slide , please . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> uh personal preferences , <EOS> uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . <EOS> um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , l_e_d_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . <EOS> next slide , please . <EOS> um just talking to the um manufacturing division . <EOS> they suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , <EOS> so you shake it and it increases the power . <EOS> um i'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , <EOS> they have yet to get back to me on that . <EOS> so next slide , please . <EOS> suggested casing options . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , <EOS> very specific to the customer . <EOS> options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . <EOS> i don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one , because splinters <EOS>
