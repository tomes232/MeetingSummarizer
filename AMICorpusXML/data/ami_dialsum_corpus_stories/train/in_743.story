yeah yeah , uh-huh . <EOS> there , mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah exactly . <EOS> uh so today i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . <EOS> um can you go to the next sli slide please ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> the metal is like uh <EOS> in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . <EOS> it takes the power from a battery <EOS> say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . <EOS> it should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want <EOS> and then um uh th <EOS> this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source <EOS> and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller <EOS> and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a t_v_ or a air conditioner , something like that so . <EOS>
