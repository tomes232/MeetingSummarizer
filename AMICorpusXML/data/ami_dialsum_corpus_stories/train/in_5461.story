alright , yeah . <EOS> crack on . <EOS> okay so <EOS> we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes . <EOS> i think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . <EOS> those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , l_c_d_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being i suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . <EOS> um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , <EOS> the idea to try and separate us <EOS> and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . <EOS> um that pretty much sums up the last one . <EOS> so <EOS> we'll just crack on , <EOS> um like to maybe start with the industrial designer if it's possible . <EOS> um uh the con today is the concep today . <EOS> this uh meeting is the conceptual design phase <EOS> and is um <EOS>
