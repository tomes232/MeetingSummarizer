mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> what would be the cost do do we know ? <EOS> um that's on the next <EOS> i th i think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , <EOS> but it does affect the printed circuit board . <EOS> um which is the next section . <EOS> basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote . <EOS> the firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . <EOS> and there's different prices according to each . <EOS> so if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button . <EOS>
