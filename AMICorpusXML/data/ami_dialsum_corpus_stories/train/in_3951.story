yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> n that way <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . <EOS> because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the t_v_s no longer have as well . <EOS> so like you have to have them somewhere , <EOS> 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . <EOS> um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . <EOS>
