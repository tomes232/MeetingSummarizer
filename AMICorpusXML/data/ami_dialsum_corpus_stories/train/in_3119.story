that one . <EOS> cool . <EOS> well <EOS> these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab . <EOS> took hundred people <EOS> and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . <EOS> um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . and general opinions about current current remotes . <EOS> see that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . <EOS> so some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly . <EOS> uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . <EOS> which is a a plus for us , <EOS> if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . <EOS> current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . <EOS> i can empl <EOS> i kinda take that to mean as um they they don't uh they , yeah , they only use they only work for the television <EOS> or <EOS> yeah like <EOS> as in in my flat i've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a d_v_d_ player , a video player and t_v_ . <EOS> if it was <EOS> uh i mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time <EOS> and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . <EOS> uh again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . <EOS> i took to mean that they just they use it a lot , <EOS> they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume . <EOS> and uh yeah , uh <EOS> i think the big issue is <EOS> fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like <EOS> well <EOS> we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , <EOS> but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used <EOS> and used very <EOS> aren't considered relevant by the user . <EOS> so i think maybe fewer buttons , <EOS> which also make the design look sleeker , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> uh um yeah and uh <EOS> frustrations of like people losing remote control . <EOS> i dunno <EOS> maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the t_v_ <EOS> or maybe that's b <EOS> it would have to incorporate , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . <EOS>
