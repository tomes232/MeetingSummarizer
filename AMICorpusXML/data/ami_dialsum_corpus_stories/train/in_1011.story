you just press <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just click . <EOS> that'll be fine . <EOS> so <EOS> the findings that i got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver <EOS> and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that <EOS> 'cause you don't need a sight line . <EOS> so that's one thing we're gonna work on . <EOS> um the user interface is critical here , <EOS> because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , <EOS> which then goes through the infra-red , <EOS> so the the chip that uh i think ian is designing , is gonna be crucial . <EOS> and really it all comes down to the to the user , <EOS> because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . <EOS> so <EOS> the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . <EOS> so you have four main components <EOS> and they are designed sort of like this . <EOS> you have your energy source right there <EOS> which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip , <EOS> which is also controlled by the users . <EOS> you have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip <EOS>
