yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> there's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . <EOS> right okay . <EOS> um <EOS> well , one one way i would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , <EOS> so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . <EOS> uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . <EOS> for example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . <EOS> maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , <EOS> things like channel and volume um are used all the time , <EOS> so we just have them right out on top , <EOS> um very just very sort of self-explanatory . <EOS> um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , <EOS> you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . <EOS> and others that are uh also available <EOS> and then others that are concealed . <EOS> something like that . <EOS>
