well <EOS> i think i find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons <EOS> and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the d_v_d_ player or whatever and the t_v_ as well . <EOS> um , but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons <EOS> and <EOS> so i think it's is best when they're clearly labelled <EOS> and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , <EOS> you know . <EOS>
