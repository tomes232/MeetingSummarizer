um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe i'll come up with more concrete ideas . <EOS> right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um <EOS> right . i'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature <EOS> that ar <EOS> you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions . <EOS> where i think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their t_v_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their t_v_ . <EOS> they want something that looks nice , <EOS> that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , <EOS> that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . <EOS> i think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share . <EOS>
