okay can we go to the next slide please ? <EOS> alright i i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas <EOS> and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . <EOS> so i'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we we could suggest anything . <EOS> i'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control <EOS> what'll be <EOS> and then i found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . <EOS> at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v_ , the v_c_r_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp . <EOS> i have to wind up ? <EOS>
