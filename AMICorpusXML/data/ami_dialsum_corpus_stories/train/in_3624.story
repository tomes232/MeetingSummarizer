hmm . <EOS> it seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature , <EOS> but if you're watching t_v_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , <EOS> and it's words . <EOS> it's not just , you know , noises like something hitting . <EOS> it's actual speech , <EOS> so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the t_v_ speech , and the the user's speech . <EOS> otherwise , you can say remote . <EOS> but if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies , <EOS>
