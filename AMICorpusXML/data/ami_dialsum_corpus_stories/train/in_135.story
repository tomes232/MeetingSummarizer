yep . <EOS> the voice recognition thing is cool . <EOS> and uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . <EOS> it's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , <EOS> but for a very fixed number of words , <EOS> you know <EOS> you have , <EOS> how many different words can you have for a remote control , <EOS> up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , <EOS> you know , <EOS> how many , <EOS> you can't have that many words . <EOS> for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . <EOS> i'm pretty sure people would buy it . <EOS> but after a while people may wanna return it , <EOS> because if you have to to say som <EOS> i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , <EOS> and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . <EOS> using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , <EOS> and that's for flickering through channels . <EOS> so if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that <EOS> and they may return it . <EOS> however , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , <EOS> there's no need to spend money on research and development , <EOS> but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , <EOS> which is an unusual feature in my opinion . <EOS> but if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . <EOS> see , you could <EOS> there're two options . <EOS> either you have voice recognition by itself , <EOS> which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , <EOS> or i don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . <EOS> so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . <EOS> but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , <EOS> because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , <EOS> it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , <EOS> you know , <EOS> it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . <EOS> as long as the voice recognition stuff works , that's that's fine . <EOS>
