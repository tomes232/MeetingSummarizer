so i think that some things that we might wanna think about , <EOS> the idea of an l_c_d_ screen was brought up <EOS> although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , <EOS> so i dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . <EOS> but something for us to consider <EOS> also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote <EOS> or what we wanna make easiest to use , <EOS> make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . <EOS> and basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , <EOS> that it has a fancy appeal <EOS> and that it's not ugly <EOS> and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , <EOS> so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that . <EOS>
