and i was thinking about different types of designs and i came up with something . <EOS> actually right here . <EOS> so what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone <EOS> like this , <EOS> where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , <EOS> i mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , <EOS> and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . <EOS> 'cause then it'll appeal to older generation <EOS> and like said retro's cool . <EOS> so it's classically retro . <EOS> so i mean that's just an idea if you guys like it . <EOS>
