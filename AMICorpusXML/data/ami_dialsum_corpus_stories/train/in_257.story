um here are two example remotes . <EOS> um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , <EOS> so i think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . <EOS> uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . <EOS> um whereas the right remote is much simpler , <EOS> it looks much more user friendly . <EOS> um so my personal preference would be the right remote . <EOS> so , it's got nice big buttons , <EOS> it's got a very limited number of buttons . <EOS> um they're nice , <EOS> kinda clearly labelled . <EOS> um i like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . <EOS> so it's very very user friendly , <EOS> and it's got a little splash of colour . <EOS> could maybe do with some more colour . <EOS> um . <EOS>
