okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . <EOS> i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i didn't want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy <EOS> so we we've got that . <EOS> the size is small , <EOS> the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . <EOS> we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , <EOS> we'll have the soft buttons <EOS> and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand <EOS> so that's nice . <EOS> and functionality i put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . <EOS> so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . <EOS> they don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it . <EOS>
