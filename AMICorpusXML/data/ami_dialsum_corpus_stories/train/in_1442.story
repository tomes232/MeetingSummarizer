n oh wha what i've <EOS> what i've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . <EOS> not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . <EOS> the inside is hard . <EOS> i don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , <EOS> i think that that's done for us . <EOS>
