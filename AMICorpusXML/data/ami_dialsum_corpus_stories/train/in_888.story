okay , <EOS> we go on to the next one . <EOS> um 'kay um yeah . <EOS> uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . <EOS> um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . <EOS> so uh um uh <EOS> that's w what i what i want to uh uh to do in uh our design . <EOS> so um <EOS> finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . um the uh i found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . <EOS> so <EOS> maybe uh we can uh use uh that . um <EOS> uh and uh using a little uh display . <EOS> so um <EOS> findings . <EOS> um yeah <EOS> just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . <EOS> so uh <EOS> only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . <EOS> um uh let's see . um yeah and uh <EOS> we uh need some uh new a attractive functions <EOS> uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . <EOS> so uh <EOS> it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . <EOS> just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . <EOS> um and yeah <EOS> overall um user-friendly . <EOS> so uh <EOS> using uh large large buttons . um <EOS> it's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . <EOS> um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . <EOS> so uh uh yeah . <EOS> and and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off <EOS> or a and <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . um <EOS> let's see . uh yeah . <EOS> i was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , <EOS> um just one button to keep it uh simple . <EOS> uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . <EOS> um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . <EOS> so uh um yeah <EOS> and w we have to keep uh in general buttons <EOS> uh so um <EOS> we've got um the buttons we have to use . the on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . <EOS> um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . <EOS> and um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . <EOS> so um <EOS> made a little uh picture of uh it . <EOS> um see . um yeah . <EOS> just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , <EOS> um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . <EOS> um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . <EOS> so um <EOS>
