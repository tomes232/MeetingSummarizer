mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> senden <EOS> okay . so uh <EOS> if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily <EOS> on the remote . <EOS> buttons . like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . <EOS> or should be covered , <EOS> or in l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> l_c_d_ screen is easy <EOS> because we have the l_c_d_ screen , we have the various options . <EOS> put one option <EOS> and then you have the all the buttons of that options , <EOS> so the other options would be gone . <EOS> and you don't see the buttons . <EOS> so l_c_d_ screens should be easy , <EOS> but an l_c_d_ screen , the problem with the l_ sc l_c_d_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the l_c_d_ screen a lot . <EOS> so we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement l_c_d_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . <EOS>
