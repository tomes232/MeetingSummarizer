can you fit any uh for example a t_f_t_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? <EOS> for example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , i can i can imagine it could be a problem . <EOS> a all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . <EOS> but we have to take care of the t_f_t_ . <EOS> well , sponginess . maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the t_f_t_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
