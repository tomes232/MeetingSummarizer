uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm sure we'll have by the end of today . <EOS> i'll give it another go . <EOS> yeah , there we go . <EOS> right , <EOS> we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . <EOS> and first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the t_v_ <EOS> and um how do people use it ? <EOS> we asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . <EOS> um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , <EOS> and what improvements would would they like to remote control . <EOS> and we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . <EOS> and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly <EOS> and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control <EOS> and that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all . <EOS> people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . <EOS> uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . <EOS> and young people were quite receptive to this , <EOS> but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . <EOS> there's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . <EOS> um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls <EOS> and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . <EOS> and the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech <EOS> a design which looks high-tech , basically . <EOS> um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , <EOS> and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as louisa said . <EOS> um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an l_c_d_ menu for other functions on the remote control . <EOS> that's worth thinking about . <EOS> um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , <EOS> because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . <EOS> that that might be the market that we're we're looking for . <EOS> and we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels . <EOS> 'cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , <EOS> so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . <EOS>
