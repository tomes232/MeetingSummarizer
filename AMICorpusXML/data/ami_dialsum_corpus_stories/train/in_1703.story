mm . <EOS> um . <EOS> uh evaluation . <EOS> basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . <EOS> um then we will <EOS> it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . <EOS> so um <EOS> not seven steps , <EOS> seven scale . <EOS> so <EOS> after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , <EOS> we average that <EOS> and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . <EOS> and uh the criteria based on real reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those i put together from the user requirements phase . <EOS> 'kay . um <EOS> if you flip the <EOS> so , <EOS> those are the criteria . <EOS> and uh perhaps i could have put 'em a bit better , <EOS> but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , <EOS> which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points . <EOS> put it mildly . <EOS> so <EOS> we have um true ? <EOS>
