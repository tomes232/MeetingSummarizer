uh-oh . <EOS> we're looking at a radically different shape . <EOS> possibly no buttons at all um , <EOS> but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . <EOS> um in the i mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , <EOS> because , you know , shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint . <EOS> but we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , uh if clearly only need the main functions . <EOS> um i don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition <EOS> um and the the only buttons that i think we need are channel control , volume control and on off . <EOS> um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme <EOS> and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers . <EOS> um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ? <EOS>
