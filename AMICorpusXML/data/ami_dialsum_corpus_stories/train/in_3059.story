mm-hmm . <EOS> could i can i interject to ask a question there , <EOS> is that appropriate ? <EOS> you're saying the triple a_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um no no , <EOS> if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky <EOS> and that's because of the size of the batteries , <EOS> they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . <EOS> yeah <EOS> the the <EOS> well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones <EOS> but i'm just wondering about power consumption <EOS> and how much you need to send the data across . <EOS> um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . <EOS> um , now the ones at the moment are small <EOS> but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . <EOS>
