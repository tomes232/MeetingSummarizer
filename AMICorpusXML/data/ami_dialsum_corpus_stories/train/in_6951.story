okay . a kind of identification , <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah f uh i know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . <EOS> it's uh kind of handshaking , uh , <EOS> when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your t_v_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . <EOS> so so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the t_v_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . <EOS> well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay . <EOS>
