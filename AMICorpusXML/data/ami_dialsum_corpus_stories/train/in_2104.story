okay . <EOS> s <EOS> uh i wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . <EOS> of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , <EOS> so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something , <EOS> or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . <EOS> uh i personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . <EOS> but i suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . <EOS> and it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . <EOS> perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons <EOS> because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , <EOS> uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . <EOS> and uh well as i said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . <EOS>
