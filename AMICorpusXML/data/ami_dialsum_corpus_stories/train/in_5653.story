um , yeah , <EOS> maybe another problem uh , <EOS> i think current t_v_s can even send infrared . <EOS> yes , <EOS> but what should we uh s i i i f <EOS> i agree with you , <EOS> but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ? <EOS> 'cause that would be i mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control . <EOS> these all uh all stuff that we have to take in account . <EOS> so i i my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . <EOS> um , well <EOS> we should uh look into the design and the functionability . <EOS> like i said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , <EOS> or well uh <EOS> just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh stuff . <EOS> and uh don't overbuild , <EOS> we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions , <EOS> but we we should stick to the basics . <EOS>
