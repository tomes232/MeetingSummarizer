i'm dealing with the inside really . so um , yeah i ran out of time so i couldn't do this one as fun as the last one . <EOS> um and uh i found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v_ <EOS> presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless <EOS> and , you don't need to send very much information . <EOS> um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . <EOS> now our one , i'm i'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue <EOS> because most of them are powered by triple a_ batteries <EOS> but those can be quite bulky <EOS> so i d i didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . <EOS> yeah sure . <EOS>
