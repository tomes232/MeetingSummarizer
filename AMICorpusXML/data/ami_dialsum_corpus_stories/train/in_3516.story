yep . <EOS> yep there we go . <EOS> okay this is uh the working design , <EOS> presented by me , the uh industrial designer extraordinaire . <EOS> 'kay , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so . <EOS> what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? <EOS> well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the t_v_ to change its state , <EOS> whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the t_v_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . <EOS> um , so i decided i'd have a look at what th other people have designed <EOS> and try and take some inspiration from that . <EOS> but uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out <EOS> and i thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area <EOS> because
