repetitive strain injury . <EOS> is installing a new remote control something that people <EOS> uh , no , that did not come up at all . <EOS> um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . <EOS> i also found that most people would <EOS> uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . <EOS> now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . <EOS> so i dunno <EOS> if that's possible we might consider getting into it . <EOS> um . <EOS> and and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , <EOS> i think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . <EOS> um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , <EOS> so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like . <EOS> you know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . <EOS>
