um and that they often lose the <EOS> it's easy to lose a remote . <EOS> um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . um <EOS> and uh some sort of locator . <EOS> either a button or tracking device . um <EOS> and that it should look different than what's out there . <EOS> um <EOS> kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . <EOS> the younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . <EOS> um uh i think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , <EOS> and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . um <EOS> then the user interface designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . <EOS> um the simple versus the um the complex . <EOS> the simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . um <EOS> um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . <EOS> um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . <EOS> um we would just have a t_v_ remote . <EOS> um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . <EOS> have it s be something that looks different . <EOS> and finally our um industrial designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . <EOS> um from energy source , um uh what we would use . <EOS> batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . um <EOS> how that would power the remote and the lamp . <EOS> if we were to to have one . <EOS> uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the t_v_ . um <EOS> i believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . um <EOS> um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . <EOS> and with a , just a few buttons . <EOS> just the basics . <EOS> and with a scrolling um function also . <EOS> okay <EOS> and i will leave that , leave it at that . <EOS> so <EOS> marketing ? <EOS> we're watching trends . <EOS> i suppose that you can have this . <EOS>
