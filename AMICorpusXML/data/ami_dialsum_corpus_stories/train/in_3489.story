um personal preferences that i was thinking through <EOS> here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . <EOS> so if we're going for fashion in our cases , i think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . <EOS> maybe titanium , <EOS> maybe some wood . <EOS> we're gonna have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual materials , <EOS> but that's sort of what i have in mind . <EOS> and we wanna go for simplicity . <EOS> probably pushbuttons , <EOS> but i'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything <EOS>
