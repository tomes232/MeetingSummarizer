yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and um , well , <EOS> my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , <EOS> keep it simple . <EOS> so uh <EOS> maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible <EOS> on t <EOS> because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the the television , <EOS> some you you'll never know <EOS> uh and never use , <EOS> and therefore it's uh important <EOS> if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy <EOS> and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them <EOS> or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions . <EOS>
