bouncing on top . <EOS> dunno . okay . um . <EOS> so this is what i've found here , <EOS> um a lot of this is new to me , <EOS> so we'll just read through together . <EOS> um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . <EOS> so they find them ugly . <EOS> most people find them ugly . <EOS> um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , <EOS> we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . <EOS> okay i'm gonna <EOS> we'll look at that in a second . <EOS> um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . <EOS> so i guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , <EOS> they tend to use the most simple controls <EOS> and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . <EOS>
