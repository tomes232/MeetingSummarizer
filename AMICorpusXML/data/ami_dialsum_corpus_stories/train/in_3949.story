if you take your time too long i will uh eventually uh <EOS> warn you . <EOS> well , <EOS> i'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions . <EOS> um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , <EOS> so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness , <EOS> so tha that's that's some of the main points . <EOS> and another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult , <EOS> so use as as little functions as possible <EOS> or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . <EOS> if you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time , <EOS> 'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see , <EOS> but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure . <EOS>
