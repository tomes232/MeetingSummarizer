what kind of th thickness are we looking at ? <EOS> um , i imagine that we could specify . <EOS> um , i don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> brilliant . <EOS> um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , <EOS> but to use those we'd have to use more chips , <EOS> um and that would cost us more . <EOS> and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons <EOS> because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . <EOS> um and just a little note there , <EOS> touch screen equals many chips <EOS> which equals many euro . <EOS>
