okay . <EOS> press on . <EOS> i've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . um <EOS> and wasn't really satisfied by what i saw i have to say <EOS> so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on . <EOS> um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . <EOS> um to save you getting off your backside . <EOS> um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . <EOS> on the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it <EOS> so about the size of the television set . <EOS> um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . <EOS> and most of these functions are not going to be used , <EOS> it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . <EOS> and on the other hand there's a user focused approach <EOS> that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used . um <EOS> with uh a and a <EOS> and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , <EOS> but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . <EOS> and so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , <EOS> and um well f the for the most part for t_v_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume . <EOS> um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a d_v_ d_v_d_ or uh v_c_r_ presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth . um . <EOS> my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . <EOS> um but uh the pro i think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance <EOS> about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most . <EOS> so , <EOS> something that's uh something that is more programmable , <EOS> that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it <EOS> but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . <EOS> um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , <EOS> um i liked ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , <EOS> and have a disp <EOS> you then have some sort of basic display on it <EOS> so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . <EOS> um , this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers , <EOS> you know <EOS> the playstation control where you have four basic function buttons <EOS> that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes <EOS> but the <EOS> and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified . <EOS> and so it's taking taking the lead from that . <EOS>
