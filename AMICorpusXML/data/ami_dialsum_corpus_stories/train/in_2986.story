yeah . <EOS> but i don't think i think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . <EOS> 'cause i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t_v_ , <EOS> which already only have the minimum number of buttons . <EOS> i don't think there's much to be gained in that area . <EOS>
