alright ? <EOS> alright . <EOS> thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . <EOS> um i think we uh made some definite progress at the last one <EOS> um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . <EOS> um i'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . <EOS> um the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly <EOS> um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . <EOS> um they've got lots of buttons on them <EOS> that uh people don't use <EOS> and find difficult to learn . <EOS> um and people lose them . <EOS> and we we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , <EOS> um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , <EOS> and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . <EOS> that <EOS> um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery <EOS> that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product <EOS> and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , a_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and b_ as uh a real reaction product . <EOS> so that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . uh <EOS> okay . so <EOS> again um , i'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you <EOS> and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . <EOS> um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , <EOS> whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . <EOS> and uh i i think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life <EOS> and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . <EOS> and uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature <EOS> that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . <EOS> um now the the the internal chip <EOS> um and uh this is where i need uh uh kate's expert advice <EOS> and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible <EOS> um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? <EOS> or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? <EOS> uh i mean <EOS> i'm i'm i'm <EOS>
