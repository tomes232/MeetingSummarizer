hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> nice . <EOS> um , one thing that i noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . <EOS> so you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it <EOS> but in fact there is light coming out of the remote <EOS> and you know the television can detect that . <EOS> and if you were to record <EOS> if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . <EOS> uh one thing that i thought might be interesting <EOS> was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . <EOS> so you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . <EOS> course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that . <EOS>
