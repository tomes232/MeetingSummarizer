could you plug me in ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , <EOS> um which is the the first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . <EOS> nobody uses teletext very much anymore , <EOS> so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . <EOS> um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . <EOS> i think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . <EOS> so um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . <EOS> and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . <EOS>
