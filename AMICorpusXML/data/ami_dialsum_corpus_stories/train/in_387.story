ha . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> alright , so <EOS> from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , <EOS> the material that we chose was wood , <EOS> and uh the colour would be customisable , <EOS> 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . <EOS> um , <EOS> so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , <EOS> and we've incorporated the l_c_d_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , <EOS> if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . <EOS> um , so <EOS> to unveil our lovely product . <EOS>
