right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , <EOS> so i'll go into the diagram first . <EOS> it just explains how the process goes through , <EOS> from a <EOS> from the basic technology point of view , <EOS> the basic steps that you need <EOS> um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> you need some power source . <EOS> 'kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . <EOS> um and that power source is important <EOS> because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . <EOS> um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies <EOS> um how far you can transmit the signal <EOS> or the complexity of the functions that you want . <EOS> like for example , voice recognition , right . <EOS> that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , <EOS> you might need to power other things , <EOS> so that's one perhaps constraint there . <EOS> um <EOS>
