okay s <EOS> so we just buy a circuit board and <EOS> okay . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> but i'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . <EOS> this i prefer that we should make ourselves . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but it depends whether we take a decision to use it . <EOS> same thing . <EOS> it's fairly expensive to use these circuits . <EOS> so , speech recognition <EOS> well , l_c_d_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use l_c_d_ , <EOS> so i agree on using any kind of l_c_d_ , <EOS> less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . <EOS> but the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know . <EOS>
