okay . <EOS> but first i will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . <EOS> i already talked about the cameras and microphones , <EOS> but they are not of uh much use to us . uh <EOS> we will have to take advantage of these two things . <EOS> they are smart boards . <EOS> as you can see , you can give a presentation on them . <EOS> and uh this one here is a white board . <EOS> i will uh instruct you about that soon . <EOS> um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder <EOS> and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . <EOS> um and yeah there are available on both smart boards <EOS> but i think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . <EOS> as you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . <EOS> um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , <EOS> um uh to go back and forward between pages , <EOS> and of course uh to save it every now and then . <EOS> um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance <EOS> like this if everything's okay , <EOS> but i first have to put it on the pen , <EOS> you see i'm new to it too . <EOS> um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want . <EOS> as you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , <EOS> it's not such a fast board , <EOS> it's a smart board but also a slow board . <EOS> uh but you can write things <EOS> and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , <EOS> so we have uh est left . <EOS> and um you can also delete an entire page , <EOS> but we ask you not to do that . <EOS> just simply create a new one <EOS> and uh start all over <EOS> because we want to save all the results . <EOS> um does everyone understand this <EOS>
