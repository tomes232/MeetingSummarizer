yeah . so <EOS> it's it's interesting information , i think . <EOS> and then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , <EOS> because it's too many buttons and so on . <EOS> so <EOS> we should change this as well . <EOS> and uh users are actually zapping a lot , <EOS> so they're using the device intensively , <EOS> that's something to take into account as well . <EOS> and um , you know , <EOS> ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . <EOS> and uh this is one of the main point for me . <EOS> but i'll come back to it later . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> could you go next slide ? <EOS> uh , so as you said uh , <EOS> remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . <EOS>
