um , i don't know what these mean because i didn't actually make the slide-show . <EOS> experience with remote control . <EOS> so i guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . <EOS> um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . <EOS>
