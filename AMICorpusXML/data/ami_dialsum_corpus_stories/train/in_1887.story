we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with <EOS> and i i um i'm i'm i'm certain that they they are around <EOS> so , um <EOS> that i don't think is a a serious problem . <EOS> the uh the the voice sensor is is expensive <EOS> but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design <EOS> so that that has to stay . <EOS> um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves <EOS> but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . <EOS> um it's simply made of plastic <EOS> so th that's uh that's no problem <EOS> and uh um <EOS> just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . <EOS> um and uh <EOS> we haven't actually got a scroll wheel <EOS> we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um slider <EOS> so um <EOS> and the and the the buttons are <EOS> uh uh well <EOS> i do don't know that they're special colour . <EOS> anyway <EOS> the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five <EOS> uh but i thi i think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different <EOS> that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers <EOS> so uh um you know <EOS> the if if <EOS> if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , <EOS> so uh <EOS> we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward <EOS> and uh uh <EOS> i i think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . um . <EOS>
