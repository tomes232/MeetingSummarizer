mm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> so it's frustrated me in the past , th that . <EOS> okay , i have also some points uh . <EOS> maybe two points . <EOS> uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , <EOS> so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . <EOS> and maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . <EOS> so something like this . <EOS>
