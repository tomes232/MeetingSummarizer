nah . <EOS> well <EOS> you can um have uh the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the t_v_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . <EOS> but the rest is uh you don't use that often , <EOS> so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . <EOS> so it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control i think , <EOS> so you can do something unique with that . <EOS>
