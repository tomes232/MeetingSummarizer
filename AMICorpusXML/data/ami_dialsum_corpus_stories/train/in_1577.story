mm-hmm . <EOS> right , <EOS> the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? <EOS> they are . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh i see . <EOS> okay . <EOS> now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries <EOS> 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , <EOS> uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later <EOS> and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller <EOS> and to turn it into an i uh infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information . now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres <EOS> which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the t_v_ <EOS> unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do <EOS> so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . <EOS> and then i was uh just had a quick look at the external design <EOS> but i d i left that mostly to the uh interface designer . <EOS>
