but <EOS> and it's not too complex to do it . <EOS> well <EOS> they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your t_v_ <EOS> and that that is bit of a tricky job . <EOS> i actually use one of those <EOS> when <EOS> they are they are kinda kinda troublesome , <EOS> but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , <EOS> because uh in order for the remote to process something from the t_v_ , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive , <EOS> and that's well <EOS>
