mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> silly for children . <EOS> yeah , for children , yeah exactly . <EOS> yeah , that's what , yeah . <EOS> like an animal or <EOS> like a doll , or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , exactly . yeah . <EOS> and and the butto buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . <EOS> if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . <EOS> if you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , <EOS> so i think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations , <EOS> like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . <EOS> so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will complicate the matter more i think so . <EOS>
