i did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls <EOS> and when they were invented and so forth , <EOS> so , <EOS> i guess this guy zenith uh created the flashmatic , <EOS> which i kinda like the idea , <EOS> 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the t_v_ on and off , <EOS> that might be interesting . <EOS> and um so <EOS> it was highly directional flash light <EOS> that uh you could turn the picture on and off , <EOS> and the sound on and off , <EOS> and change channels <EOS> c <EOS> so i think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later . <EOS>
