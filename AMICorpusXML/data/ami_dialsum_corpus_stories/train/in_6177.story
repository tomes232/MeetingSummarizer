hm . um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , i have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . <EOS> so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . <EOS> they're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . <EOS> and um <EOS> yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , <EOS> so this is the order . <EOS> channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . <EOS> the other ones are the settings , and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , <EOS> and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , <EOS> and then , just one , <EOS> and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . <EOS> um , <EOS> about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . <EOS> and if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , <EOS> i don't really know how to describe this , <EOS> um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , <EOS> while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , <EOS> so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . <EOS> um i don't i don't know um what the decision to be made is , <EOS> but i think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , <EOS> but we should discuss this together . <EOS>
