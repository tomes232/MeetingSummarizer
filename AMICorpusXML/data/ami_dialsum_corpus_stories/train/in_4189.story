so , <EOS> basically we need <EOS> uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control <EOS> we need few components , mainly the energy source like the battery <EOS> and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , <EOS> and then we have some chip , <EOS> it's mainly digital signal processing chip because <EOS> since we are i am one doing mostly digital uh devices <EOS> we ought to have some kind of processor <EOS> which take care of all these functions <EOS> and put it in some digital format . <EOS> and then we'll have the infrared l_e_d_ source <EOS> which sends the information to the main device . <EOS> then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , <EOS> and we ought to do different codes for different t_v_s , <EOS> so some t_v_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things . <EOS>
