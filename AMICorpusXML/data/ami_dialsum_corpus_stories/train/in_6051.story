inch . <EOS> oh , . <EOS> oops . <EOS> uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , <EOS> no uh i'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . <EOS> so there will be some circuit uh for the power . <EOS> so , say power circuit here . <EOS> uh the main energy will be taken from batteries <EOS> that we can uh uh <EOS> and if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , <EOS> which i found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . <EOS> i was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . <EOS> so no problem . <EOS> there can be also solar cell . <EOS> uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , <EOS> so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . <EOS> so at least seven to seven . <EOS>
