i see this a little more smoothly than the last one . <EOS> okay right , let's get started . um <EOS> basically the uh for the <EOS> um i'll back actually . <EOS> for the components design , um next step is <EOS> basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . <EOS> we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . <EOS> then there is a chip <EOS> and still the sender . <EOS> so um yes including the power s supply as well . <EOS> um i'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . <EOS> uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , <EOS> um . <EOS> there's a dynamo . <EOS> any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up <EOS> um . <EOS> there's a kinetic option , <EOS> which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement <EOS> which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . <EOS> um that's one option , <EOS> but i think that was gonna cost a little more . <EOS> and then there's solar cells . um as a final option . <EOS> for the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , <EOS> which is <EOS> oh just to say all all these are um supplied by real reaction . <EOS> so i guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . <EOS> um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , <EOS> which i guess is just the same as the standard ones . <EOS> this says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer . <EOS>
