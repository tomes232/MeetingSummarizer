um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . <EOS> people are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . <EOS> and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . <EOS> people also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . <EOS> so we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , <EOS> because they're used much more infrequently <EOS> and probably just complicate what's going on . <EOS>
