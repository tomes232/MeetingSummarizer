and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , <EOS> because if we're gonna sell this thing , i think the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . <EOS> twenty five euros makes a nice little present , <EOS> and we want it to be an impulse purchase , <EOS> we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee i just gotta have that . <EOS> and take out their wallet and buy it . <EOS> so it's gotta be really attractive <EOS> and it <EOS> but it's gotta go to market by september , <EOS> 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in september showing it around , isn't gonna sell for christmas . <EOS> um and then i'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it <EOS> and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour <EOS> and i'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . <EOS>
