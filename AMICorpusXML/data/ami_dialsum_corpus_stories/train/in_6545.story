okay . <EOS> well <EOS> we can try to make it special . <EOS> so <EOS> do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability <EOS> or user <EOS> well <EOS> well <EOS> i th i thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , <EOS> we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , <EOS> so uh that's no matter . <EOS> um if we uh control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , <EOS> because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , <EOS> so uh <EOS> it's not only for the uh technical persons . <EOS> um i think it must be a very good control , <EOS> so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , <EOS> the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality . <EOS>
