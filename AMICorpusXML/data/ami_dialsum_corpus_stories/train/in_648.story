um so i think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , <EOS> the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the t_v_ . <EOS> and also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the t_v_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . <EOS> so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , <EOS> um input which would probably be buttons , <EOS> although um we just talked about voice recognition , <EOS> processor to take the information , <EOS> um something to transmit it to the t_v_ , <EOS> and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . <EOS> and also you need a sender for location signal , <EOS> which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their t_v_ or stick it on their wall . <EOS> and this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . <EOS> power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , <EOS> um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb <EOS> which is probably the easiest way to send to the t_v_ . <EOS> and then for the location function , you would have a sender on the t_v_ which would output some sort of signal , <EOS> um we could use i_r_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . <EOS> that signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , <EOS> and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . <EOS> um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , <EOS> that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , <EOS> um a button pad for input , <EOS> um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , <EOS> i_r_ transmitter to communicate to the t_v_ , <EOS> that's just sort of standard , um so most t_v_s have an i_r_ receiver . <EOS> probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it <EOS> and i'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . <EOS>
