mm-hmm . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> cou could you go back for a second ? <EOS> uh switching on off channel , uh volume , <EOS> okay , that's great . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> um um among the findings i found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design , like operating a v_c_r_ , <EOS> but they don't seem to be able to deal with d_v_d_ players , <EOS> but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , <EOS> but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . <EOS> so my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . <EOS> and then it must be easy to use , <EOS> so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button <EOS> and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . <EOS>
