okay . um <EOS> kate . <EOS> oh i'm sorry , oh sorry . <EOS> um p there we go . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> i'll just be talking about the components design . <EOS> and <EOS> okay , <EOS> basically i just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . <EOS> uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command <EOS> and then this is translated uh into uh light signals <EOS> which are then seen by the t_v_ . <EOS> uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery <EOS> and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor <EOS> and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . um . <EOS> uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command <EOS> and this creates a a connection within the the remote <EOS> that allows the chip <EOS> the chip then senses this connection <EOS> and produces a signal in a morse code format . <EOS> this signal's sent to the transistor <EOS> which amplifies it <EOS> and then sends it on to the light emitting diode <EOS> and uh <EOS> which is then trai changed into a infrared light <EOS> which is sent to the t_v_ <EOS> and sort of seen by the t_v_ <EOS> and which uh changes the channels . <EOS> um . oh . uh <EOS> cool . <EOS> uh so <EOS> as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . <EOS> uh y the fewer buttons you have , i guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . um <EOS> however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult <EOS> and uh raise the production cost . <EOS> that's something we should think about . <EOS> also we have to work within the company constraints , <EOS> and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons <EOS> and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . <EOS> um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , <EOS> so i was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery <EOS> and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years <EOS> and we could still keep that original idea . <EOS> um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , <EOS> and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility <EOS> and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . <EOS> um , however that's gonna cost more , <EOS> but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper <EOS> and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , <EOS> but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , <EOS> which haven't really been used much on remotes , <EOS> so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , <EOS> so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . <EOS> and that pretty much sums it up . <EOS>
