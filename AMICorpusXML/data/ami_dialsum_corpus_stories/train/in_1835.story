mm . <EOS> any ideas on that ? <EOS> i mean i know the ipods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons <EOS> which are exactly like what they're describing , <EOS> so that might be something we wanna look into . <EOS> and i'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . <EOS> solar i don't think would be such a good idea , <EOS> because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . <EOS> but this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , <EOS> and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , <EOS> i think that that m would be a very interesting thing . <EOS> but i think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip <EOS> to keep our costs down . <EOS> uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an l_c_d_ . <EOS> so i think we want to be aware of not making things overly t <EOS>
