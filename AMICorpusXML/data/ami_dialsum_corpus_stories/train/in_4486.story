the buttons should be large . <EOS> they shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . <EOS> they should be easy to press , very comfortable . <EOS> um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a v_ on them , <EOS> so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . <EOS> um should avoid s things like that . <EOS> um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . <EOS>
