mm . <EOS> so . <EOS> i also did a little research <EOS> on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . <EOS> fancy . <EOS> functional is out . <EOS> and f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , i'm i'm thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . <EOS> this is twice as important as the next finding , <EOS> which is technologically innovative . <EOS> this is interesting , <EOS> 'cause i think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , <EOS> but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . <EOS> ease of use . again , pretty low , <EOS> i mean it's the top three , <EOS> but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . <EOS>
