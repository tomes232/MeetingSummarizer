mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> despite working in interface design , i'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . <EOS> you'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , <EOS> sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your t_v_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . <EOS> and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , <EOS> so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . <EOS> and then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . <EOS> and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your t_v_ <EOS> and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . <EOS> so that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . <EOS>
