what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , i mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , <EOS> i was thinking , yellow and black , <EOS> just because that's the company's colours , <EOS> with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom <EOS> instead of instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . <EOS> and when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , <EOS> it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching . <EOS>
