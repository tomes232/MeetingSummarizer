mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , so let me finish with the the constraints which are almost done . <EOS> so we also need to to find the a spot for the photocopier , the fax machine , and the printer . <EOS> the fax , you know , is very small , <EOS> but um the photocopier is quite huge , <EOS> and the printer is uh well ab this size . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> the offices comes with white boards . <EOS> not very uh very important . <EOS> uh the furniture that w each each person has <EOS> and uh you have a list of people . <EOS> so the thing uh you you ought to know is that we're not the only ones that w we're thin that that are thinking about uh for well , about putting people i in these rooms . <EOS> um there is another group that is also having discussions . <EOS> so the idea is that today we'll just try to f start seeing the main constraints <EOS> and then you have time to to go and think about it uh <EOS> ask the people you know , your assistants , for instance , <EOS> and at the next meeting we'll try to to come with one solution . <EOS> uh , the other group will also propose a solution <EOS> and then there will be another negotiation . <EOS>
