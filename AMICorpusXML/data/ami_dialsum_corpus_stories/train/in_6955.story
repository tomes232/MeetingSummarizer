so , <EOS> the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , <EOS> as you probably all know . <EOS> the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . <EOS> course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , <EOS> but uh personally i think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . <EOS> um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , <EOS> so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . <EOS> this is how today seems to be going to work . <EOS> we're gonna have the three kay phases , <EOS> as you've probably already been told , <EOS> the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . um <EOS> first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . <EOS> second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , <EOS> and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . <EOS> of course , you've all got the similar emails , i believe , <EOS> right . <EOS>
