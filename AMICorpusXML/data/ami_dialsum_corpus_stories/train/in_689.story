yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , <EOS> so you're passing through all the channels . <EOS> so , when you say i want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , <EOS> so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . <EOS> but if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . <EOS> just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? <EOS>
