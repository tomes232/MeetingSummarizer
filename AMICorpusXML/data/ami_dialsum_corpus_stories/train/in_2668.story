hmm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> findings . <EOS> fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . <EOS> so we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , <EOS> but some somewhat bi bigger than small , <EOS> so you don't lose it that much anymore . <EOS> seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , <EOS> and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , <EOS> so the buttons sh should be that small , <EOS> or shouldn't be that complex <EOS> because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . <EOS>
