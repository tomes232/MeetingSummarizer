so this is our project . <EOS> what we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . <EOS> um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , <EOS> so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . <EOS> the method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . <EOS> there's the functional design of the the remote control . <EOS> we're going <EOS> the way we'll do that i think is to to work individually initially <EOS> and then come together for meetings to to work on that . <EOS> um similarly with the conceptual design , <EOS> we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops <EOS> and then we'll bring what we've done together . <EOS> um and then the detailed design will come after that . <EOS> we'll pull it all together . <EOS>
