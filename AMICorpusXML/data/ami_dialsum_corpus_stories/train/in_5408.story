hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> i had a look on the on the web uh to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . <EOS> in analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them , <EOS> uh what things do they get right , <EOS> what's bad about them , <EOS> what's wrong with 'em , <EOS> um how we can improve on the designs that that that i found <EOS> and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . <EOS> here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . <EOS> um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , <EOS> so it's one that's got lots of buttons , <EOS> it's it's fully featured , <EOS> everything you might possibly want to do is there , <EOS> you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's it's fully featured <EOS> and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , <EOS> but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your t_v_ . <EOS>
