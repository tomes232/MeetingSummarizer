so , we need to examine each element separately , <EOS> but we're designing a full thing , <EOS> so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . <EOS> the main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . <EOS> these are all things that we had sort of addressed before , <EOS> but i'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here <EOS> as we figure out what they should be made of <EOS> and what they should look like . <EOS> the case , <EOS> uh the options that i've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , <EOS> um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . <EOS> i haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , <EOS> just keep that in mind , <EOS> but these are the options that we have from manufacturing <EOS> and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , <EOS> but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . <EOS> that would be our case . <EOS> um buttons , <EOS> for buttons we have um pushbuttons , <EOS> which is what real reaction uses the most often , <EOS> but we also have scror scroll wheels , <EOS> which can have integrated pushbuttons , <EOS> or we could go all high-tech <EOS> and have an l_ l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , <EOS> depending on what our other needs are . <EOS> and then battery i think is where things get most exciting . <EOS> we're talking about long-life batteries here . <EOS> um we can we can have your sort of basic double a_ batteries , <EOS> but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery , <EOS> like are used in high-tech watches , <EOS> where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . <EOS>
