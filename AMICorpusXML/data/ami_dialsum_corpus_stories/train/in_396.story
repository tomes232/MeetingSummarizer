i'm afraid yeah . <EOS> we'll go into that a bit more , <EOS> but please go on . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing . <EOS> though i would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that <EOS> which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . <EOS> as for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like i say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , <EOS> but it's not absolutely necessary . <EOS> really the curve that's most needed is the underside <EOS> so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . <EOS> um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . <EOS>
