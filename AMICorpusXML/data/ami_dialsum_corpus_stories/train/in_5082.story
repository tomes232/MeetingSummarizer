mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah that's a very good idea , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . <EOS> they're big selling items . <EOS> people put a lot of thought into that <EOS> so we can leverage off that , <EOS> and we can start using some of their ideas . <EOS> um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , <EOS> but still a big issue . <EOS> um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , <EOS> uh that's one thing we could look at . <EOS> there are other aspects like l_c_d_ screens and speech recognition which weren't i don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . <EOS> i think we're better doing something basic like this <EOS> which is very important <EOS> and very will be a really cool feature to put in . <EOS>
