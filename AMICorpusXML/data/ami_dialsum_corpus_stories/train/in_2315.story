um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , <EOS> which i think we've kind of already discussed before . <EOS> um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . <EOS> and again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . <EOS> and thirdly the remote would be easy to use . <EOS> as far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . <EOS> so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , <EOS> but we can try . <EOS>
