hmm . <EOS> so you finding , <EOS> just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , <EOS> and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , <EOS> and uh uh <EOS> that's , <EOS> with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , <EOS> and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor <EOS> that amplify to make it stronger <EOS> um .
