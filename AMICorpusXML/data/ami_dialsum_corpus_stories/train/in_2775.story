mm-hmm . good point . <EOS> and uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit . <EOS> uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . <EOS> if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . <EOS> and it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures . <EOS> suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures . <EOS> and uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility . <EOS> and the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor <EOS> uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through through through the uh remote controller <EOS> and uh also a capacitor <EOS> which is a b which is a m i think it's it's like a battery , capacitor . <EOS> can you go on to the next slide , please ? <EOS>
