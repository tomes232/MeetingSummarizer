the important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . <EOS> the most important by far was the look and feel of it . <EOS> it needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . it needs to stand out . <EOS> it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . <EOS> most people find remote controls boring at the moment , <EOS> we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . <EOS> people will wanna buy it . um <EOS> that was twice as i important as the next item on here <EOS> which is that it has to be technologically innovative <EOS> has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . <EOS> people have to then think about it and say got something there that i want . that's a really cool feature , <EOS> and it has to make them wanna buy it again . <EOS> third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , <EOS> it has to be easy to use . <EOS> so they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . <EOS> drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . <EOS> this is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . <EOS> um i had a talk to the design people about this , <EOS> but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . <EOS> that would make it stand out . um . <EOS>
