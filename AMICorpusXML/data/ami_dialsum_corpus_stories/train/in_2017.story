um , my second part of my findings <EOS> uh the mo <EOS> most current remotes use this silicone uh p_c_b_ board which pr printed circuit board , <EOS> which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit <EOS> and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message <EOS> and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code <EOS> and then it's fired out of this l_e_d_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts . <EOS>
