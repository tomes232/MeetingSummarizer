okay . <EOS> how would that work ? <EOS> so <EOS> you've got say maybe a v_c_r_ and a t_v_ which are separate , <EOS> so you <EOS> on my one at home i've got a v_c_r_ remote <EOS> which then changes the channel on the v_c_r_ <EOS> and doesn't do anything on the t_v_ , <EOS> so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the t_v_ or use the v_c_r_ ? <EOS> or does it know which one you want to use ? <EOS>
