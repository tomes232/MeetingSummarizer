excellent . <EOS> and the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , <EOS> but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . <EOS> because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because i think i believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . <EOS> otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . <EOS> so this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . <EOS> so we have to take care of this fact also . <EOS>
