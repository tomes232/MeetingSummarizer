i just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , <EOS> um i dunno if this will work but <EOS> and i think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . <EOS> just i mean i like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , <EOS> uh but i mean i think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . <EOS>
