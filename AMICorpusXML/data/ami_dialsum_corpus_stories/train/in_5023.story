i'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? <EOS> uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as i understand it ? <EOS> i think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be <EOS> we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control <EOS> and what what specific things it it has to do <EOS> but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that <EOS> and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . <EOS>
