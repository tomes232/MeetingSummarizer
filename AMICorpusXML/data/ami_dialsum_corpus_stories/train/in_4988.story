well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . <EOS> the base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , <EOS> and it's gonna be plastic . <EOS> um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . <EOS> um because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . <EOS> um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . <EOS> um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through . <EOS> it's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow . <EOS> the whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . <EOS>
