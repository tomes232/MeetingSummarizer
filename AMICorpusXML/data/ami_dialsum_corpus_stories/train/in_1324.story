good . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> yeah , and that's fine . <EOS> is it okay ? <EOS> alri <EOS> okay . so , basically , <EOS> the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . <EOS> so , in our case , existing remote controls . <EOS> and then , what the good ideas are , <EOS> and what the bad ideas are , <EOS> and why they're bad and good , <EOS> which isn't always as obvious . <EOS> we seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , <EOS> but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . <EOS> then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , <EOS> 'cause that'll feed into both ed's work and christine's work . <EOS> um and then what the remote control should look like , <EOS> obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . <EOS> so , <EOS> in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off . <EOS> you need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . <EOS> you need to be able to control the volume <EOS> and then control any menus on the t_v_ to regulate contrast or whatever . <EOS> so , <EOS> the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . <EOS> the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do . <EOS> um often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , <EOS> um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . <EOS> and that the buttons are too small . <EOS>
