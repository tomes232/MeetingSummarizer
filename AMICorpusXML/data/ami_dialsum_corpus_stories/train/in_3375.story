uh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that's the problem . <EOS> well what what would you guess as a shape ? <EOS> or what what would be the shape ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think i think their being uh large or small is not important . <EOS> the only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . <EOS> so let's say an average size , okay , <EOS> and it should not be very heavy also . <EOS> and i prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , <EOS> so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . <EOS> so we c it's like like some joysticks . <EOS> you can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . <EOS> so the general shape should be like this . <EOS> i think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . <EOS> so uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's i think it's that's my opinion . it's easier . <EOS>
