the details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . <EOS> the underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really <EOS> top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , <EOS> and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , <EOS> which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp <EOS> which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television <EOS> which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . um <EOS> so much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . <EOS> its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . <EOS> when you press a key um you complete a specific connection . <EOS> the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . <EOS> it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . <EOS> right . pretty clear . <EOS> transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light . <EOS> the sensor in the t_v_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . <EOS> this is the circuit board from the other side . <EOS> um the lower part of it , <EOS> i don't know if you can see that properly , <EOS> with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . <EOS> um you can see the circuit board itself . <EOS> that's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . <EOS> um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . <EOS> these are the actual keys that are being pressed . <EOS> they close the electric circuit . <EOS> that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . <EOS> that would be behind here . <EOS> um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that <EOS>
