mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so uh this is the circuit board . <EOS> the green one is a circuit board . <EOS> actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive . <EOS> uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper , <EOS> because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing , <EOS> because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you don't need to use wires and all . <EOS> it's not exactly wires we are using . <EOS> it's just printing something on a board . <EOS> tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits . <EOS>
