yeah . <EOS> um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> so again a big design issue there . <EOS> um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . um <EOS> the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , <EOS> it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh <EOS> fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . <EOS> uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use <EOS> and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . <EOS> um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . <EOS> you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . <EOS> um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , <EOS> again that was to aid i think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . <EOS> something we didn't put to them , but which i'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . <EOS> um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . <EOS> so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five <EOS> and in the older age group it kind of reverses , <EOS> they're not so bothered with this . <EOS>
