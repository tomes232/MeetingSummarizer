mm-hmm . <EOS> and we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller . <EOS> can you go to the next slide , please . <EOS> and how it works , how the remote controller works . <EOS> when you press a button go away . <EOS> thank you . uh when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection <EOS> that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , <EOS> and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . <EOS> suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed . <EOS> it pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . <EOS>
