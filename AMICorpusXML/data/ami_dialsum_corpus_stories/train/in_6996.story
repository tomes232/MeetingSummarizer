uh . yeah . that's . okay . <EOS> okay <EOS> i've got a presentation about the working design . <EOS> um first about how it works . <EOS> it's really simple of course . <EOS> everybody knows how a remote works . <EOS> the user presses a button . <EOS> the remote determines what button it is , <EOS> uses the infrared to send a signal to the t_v_ . <EOS> the t_v_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . <EOS> so <EOS> we've got um the the plate . <EOS> it gots conductive disks for every button . <EOS> when the user presses a button , a signal got sent , <EOS> goes to the led <EOS> and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v_ . <EOS> it's a very simple device , technically speaking . <EOS> so <EOS> this is a schematic overview . <EOS> you've got the buttons . <EOS> the power source . <EOS> and uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . <EOS> the chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . <EOS> when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . <EOS> well um <EOS> i think we should use default materials , simple plastics . <EOS> keep the inner workings simple , <EOS> so it's robust . <EOS> uh i think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , <EOS> because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . <EOS> and uh you only have to design a remote once , <EOS> and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . <EOS> so <EOS> it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . <EOS>
