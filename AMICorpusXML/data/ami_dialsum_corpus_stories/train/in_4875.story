it's like if you're holding it <EOS> yeah . it's okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> next slide ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> and so personally i think that we need a modern eye-catching design , <EOS> but it it really needs to be simple . <EOS> so saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , <EOS> i think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . <EOS> where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . <EOS> um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . <EOS>
