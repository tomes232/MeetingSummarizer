yeah okay but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then yeah . <EOS> yeah i mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . <EOS> also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . <EOS> so you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . <EOS> i mean if you grab it . <EOS> but most most of the times if a if if a t_v_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on . <EOS> so we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo <EOS>
