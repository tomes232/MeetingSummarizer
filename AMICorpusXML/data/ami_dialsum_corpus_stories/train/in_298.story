um i hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the t_v_ <EOS> like you have to do one for the power of the t_v_ <EOS> and then like another one to get the actual screen on <EOS> and something else to get it all going , i don't know . <EOS> now they keep combining all different remotes together , <EOS> and i don't know if i necessarily like that <EOS> 'cause i feel like you end up with multimedia overload . <EOS> i just wanna watch the t_v_ um . <EOS>
