which i think is a really good idea . <EOS> but we can implement it with simple push buttons , <EOS> which is much cheaper . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like up , down , left and right . <EOS> which is good . <EOS> and then and then <EOS> yeah , so i mean <EOS> either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . <EOS> so all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . <EOS>
