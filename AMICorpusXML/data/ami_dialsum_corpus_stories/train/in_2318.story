this is the basic basic premise of a remote control . <EOS> um the basic function is to send messages to another system . <EOS> okay <EOS> so much is clear . <EOS> an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , <EOS> that can compose messages . often in the form of infrared bits . <EOS> this is the most mostly used . <EOS> um there's uh also some sound systems <EOS> but infrared is the better or the more more used system . <EOS> um parts are cheaper as well . <EOS> a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . <EOS> this is where my people screwed up basically . <EOS> so i'm going to explain that on the board rather . <EOS> um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . <EOS> we'll start with an energy source . <EOS> right . um <EOS> which is usually a battery <EOS> right ? <EOS>
