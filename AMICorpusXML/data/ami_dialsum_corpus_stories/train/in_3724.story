okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we got <EOS> some the bad stuff we got , <EOS> remotes are often lost . <EOS> i often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , <EOS> and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . <EOS> most buttons are not used any more , <EOS> like you said , teletext is outdated now . <EOS> i remember trying to load a d_v_d_ player recently , <EOS> and there were so many buttons , <EOS> it took me i don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , <EOS> 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , <EOS> you know <EOS> there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . <EOS> and if they do , not very often . <EOS> takes too long to master the remote control . <EOS> i've seen some remote controls that are big , <EOS> they have a lot of buttons , <EOS> you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , <EOS> they're just not great to use . <EOS> we just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , <EOS> people do not like remote controls . <EOS> some of the good stuff we got . <EOS> between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . <EOS> now don't get excited yet , <EOS> i've got more to say on that . <EOS> most people'd be willing to pay for that <EOS> um most people want remote controls to be pretty , <EOS> they want it to be fancy , <EOS> th they they want it to be different , <EOS> everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , <EOS> not everybody wants that . <EOS> finally , my opinion . <EOS>
