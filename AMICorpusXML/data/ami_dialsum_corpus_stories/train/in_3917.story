sorry . <EOS> on a little print plate <EOS> uh which uh makes uh uh a connection <EOS> that uh <EOS> gives the chips , <EOS> uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . <EOS> uh senses that a connection has been made , <EOS> and know <EOS> and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . <EOS> um uh the the chip uh makes a morse code uh like uh signal <EOS> which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors <EOS> which makes <EOS> uh which sends the signal to a little let . <EOS> you know what a let is ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> and that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal <EOS> which is sent to the television set . <EOS> uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . <EOS>
