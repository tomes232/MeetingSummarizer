that's not cool . oh well . <EOS> anyways . um alright , yeah , so um <EOS> i'll just do my presentation on the working design uh . <EOS> oh there we go . <EOS> okay um <EOS> just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . <EOS> uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ player or whatever . <EOS> um and it does this uh by well , you need to start off you need an energy source <EOS> and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip <EOS> and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote <EOS> um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the d_v_d_ to tell that what to do . <EOS> um and you need a user interface , <EOS> which controls the chip and thus the messages <EOS> and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . um <EOS>
