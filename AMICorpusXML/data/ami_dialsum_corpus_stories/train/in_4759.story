amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . <EOS> now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . <EOS> um the way it works is that you have the keys here . <EOS> the rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . <EOS> and thus gives on the signal . <EOS> now this is the simple version . <EOS> um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . <EOS> we are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . <EOS> and not only that . <EOS> um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . <EOS> um i've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , <EOS> rubber , as well . <EOS> um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . <EOS> so it's pretty squishy . <EOS> that would that would serve that purpose . <EOS> um we could also use wood , or titanium . <EOS>
