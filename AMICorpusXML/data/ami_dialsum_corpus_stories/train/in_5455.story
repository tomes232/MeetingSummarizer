you have one in mind ? <EOS> i'm gonna about the uh spider <EOS> because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . <EOS> the spider has a <EOS> spider lives in a web <EOS> and uh it has eight legs , <EOS> and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . <EOS> unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . <EOS> there are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . <EOS> and uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly <EOS> like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material <EOS> but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else . <EOS> so i think they did this in uh in charlotte's web that movie <EOS> that little uh <EOS> well it's actually a book first <EOS> but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . <EOS> so , that's my animal . <EOS>
