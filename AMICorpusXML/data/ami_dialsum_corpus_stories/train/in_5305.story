mm-hmm . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> but i'm sh i'm sure open to to market this in either direction . <EOS> but you guys came up with a great product , <EOS> and at that cost i think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . <EOS> the only limitations i see to this is that we're focused on television only . <EOS> uh that's the only that's the only drawback i see to this . <EOS> but with all of these other features i think people c one thing i'm i'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . <EOS> there's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my d_v_d_ and my but i like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . <EOS>
