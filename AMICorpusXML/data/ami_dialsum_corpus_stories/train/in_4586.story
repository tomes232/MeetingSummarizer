uh , yeah . <EOS> this one ? <EOS> i think so , yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's the one . <EOS> so , it's a very short presentation , <EOS> 'cause i'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board <EOS> so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , <EOS> um , which basically shows , sort of <EOS> i took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , <EOS> which i completely agree with christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . <EOS> and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , <EOS> so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . <EOS>
