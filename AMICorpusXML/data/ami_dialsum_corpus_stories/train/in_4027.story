not as artistic as heather's drawing . <EOS> bit more cartoon style . <EOS> but i like cats because they're so independent , <EOS> and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . <EOS> um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , <EOS> and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside <EOS> as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , <EOS> and generally just , they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing . <EOS> uh i reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . <EOS> they know what they want . <EOS> basically , that's why i like cats . <EOS>
