um it's come to my attention the following . <EOS> teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . <EOS> remote control should only be used for the t_v_ . um mm . <EOS> due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , <EOS> um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . <EOS> um . now . <EOS> just to say quickly uh i would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . <EOS> um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . <EOS> so <EOS> to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . <EOS> um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . <EOS> um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . <EOS>
