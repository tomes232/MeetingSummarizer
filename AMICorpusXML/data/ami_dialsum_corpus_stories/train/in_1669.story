mm 'kay . <EOS> either . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , <EOS> where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . <EOS> um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . <EOS> so i think for our remote control <EOS> there is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , <EOS> but i think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons <EOS> like the the top right for on and off or something , <EOS> i think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . <EOS>
