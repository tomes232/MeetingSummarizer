mm-hmm <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that's for the main functions i think <EOS> and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . <EOS> for instance i think net <EOS> next slide . <EOS> one of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , <EOS> so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons <EOS> but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . <EOS> so we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control <EOS> and as we can see it really depends on the age . <EOS> young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . <EOS> and uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down . <EOS> so now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? <EOS> i think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . <EOS>
