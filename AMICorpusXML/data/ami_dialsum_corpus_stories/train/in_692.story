okay . <EOS> and so in the research that i was doing there's basically two types of remotes , <EOS> ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , <EOS> which i don't know if i can access the web page from here , <EOS> but i can show you uh . <EOS> yeah . so this is a engineer centred one , <EOS> so you see it's rather busy , <EOS> but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . <EOS> uh and this is a user centred one . <EOS> uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , <EOS> you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . <EOS> and i <EOS> judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting i kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , <EOS> uh or the direction we were going in at least . um . <EOS>
