hmm . <EOS> and so <EOS> my personal preferences <EOS> i i just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , <EOS> uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery <EOS> or a battery dock you could place it in , <EOS> so it'd constantly be charged , <EOS> so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . <EOS> uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , <EOS> so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . <EOS> uh also definitely a user-friendly interface <EOS> um and i think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , <EOS> so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . <EOS> and that's pretty much it . <EOS>
