uh to be to be quick <EOS> there's a lot of words here <EOS> but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . <EOS> the first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . <EOS> and uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . it has to be fancy . <EOS> strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , <EOS> it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside <EOS> and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing <EOS> which we w may think that would have been the most important , <EOS> which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . <EOS> so as you see uh it first have to be very nice , <EOS> s something that people are proud of <EOS> uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with <EOS> uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff <EOS> that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . <EOS>
