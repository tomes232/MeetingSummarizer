into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red l_e_d_ , which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal . you need a on-off switch <EOS> um i don't know how that got in there . <EOS> and uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of t_v_s . <EOS> so we need to know all the different you know all the different signals <EOS> and so that'll require some memory as well . <EOS> um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . <EOS> you ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , <EOS> and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , <EOS> and then passes that signal on to the infra-red l_e_d_ <EOS> and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . <EOS> so those are the basic components that need to go into this <EOS> and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around . <EOS>
