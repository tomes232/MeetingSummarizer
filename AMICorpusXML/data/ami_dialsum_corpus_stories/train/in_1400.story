right . <EOS> yep . <EOS> there might be one other problem with the transmission , <EOS> um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . <EOS> um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . <EOS> i it <EOS> you may not require that , <EOS> but you know , um it's it's <EOS> it's something very natural , i guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , <EOS> and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . <EOS> then you need to send the signal out , <EOS> so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the t_v_'s at that chair , and i'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . <EOS> so in that sense , there's not really a restriction <EOS> but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . <EOS> not so much further down . <EOS>
