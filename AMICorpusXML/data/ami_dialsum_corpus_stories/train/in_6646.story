so , then i had a look at new products that are on the market . <EOS> not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . <EOS> um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . <EOS> i have a <EOS> there is a picture . <EOS> you surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . <EOS> store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , t_v_ , cable , satellite , v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ and audio . <EOS> and you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . <EOS> so the technology is there . <EOS> um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . <EOS> you can sort of just make those out . <EOS> and then on the right is obviously an ipod , <EOS> which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , <EOS> and really is , <EOS> and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . <EOS> that is a possibility . <EOS> and nothing's simpler really . <EOS> um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , <EOS> where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . <EOS> so the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . <EOS> and um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . <EOS> so i don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , <EOS> maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . <EOS>
