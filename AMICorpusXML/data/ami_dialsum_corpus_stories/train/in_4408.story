so , <EOS> here we've got two examples <EOS> where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . <EOS> the buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . <EOS> um they're hard to see , <EOS> and okay , <EOS> they're labelled , <EOS> but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . <EOS> whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control <EOS> that i think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed . <EOS> and it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . <EOS> so , i would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . <EOS> and if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . <EOS>
