hmm . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> these were the basic findings from today . <EOS> the last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . <EOS> uh i just quickly jotted them down . <EOS> um so <EOS> basically uh the <EOS> as i told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , <EOS> so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . <EOS> um <EOS> also uh the remote control should be used only for television , <EOS> because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . <EOS> and the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . <EOS> how however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple . <EOS> um <EOS> also the management wants that um our design should be unique <EOS> uh it <EOS> so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . <EOS> okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . <EOS> um <EOS> there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . <EOS> the user interf interface communicates with the chip , <EOS> so i'll basic go over to the <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . <EOS> there is a user interface here . <EOS> so whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip <EOS> and the chip then generates a response <EOS> and takes the response to an infrared terminal , <EOS> um which then <EOS> so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , <EOS> which is then communicated to the remote site , <EOS> which h has an infrared receiver . <EOS> um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . <EOS> um <EOS> so these are the essent <EOS> so a all the functionality of the remote control , <EOS> whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically . <EOS>
