hmm . <EOS> um smart chip that perverts uh that permits , sorry , universal application <EOS> again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , <EOS> and that's kinda it . <EOS> uh this is my fifty second design . <EOS> power source over here . <EOS> we're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . <EOS> um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , <EOS> um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . <EOS> um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . <EOS>
