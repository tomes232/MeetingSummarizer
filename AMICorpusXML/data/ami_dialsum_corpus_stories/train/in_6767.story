hmm . <EOS> and the the having the the the screen on the television screen i think is a good idea , <EOS> 'cause um otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the l_c_d_ in , but for the electronics as well . <EOS> and it's a little bit pointless as well i think . <EOS> like <EOS> when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , <EOS> just a little menu showing <EOS> yeah , <EOS> a menu , you go into one menu <EOS> and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment . <EOS>
