um , so i was quite pleased with that . <EOS> one thing that we didn't do <EOS> um obviously we had a choice with the buttons <EOS> whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , <EOS> but we just went for a classic rubber button <EOS> and um since we did that <EOS> we didn't have to use as many microchips <EOS> which was quite nice <EOS> and that's what helped keep the cost down . <EOS> so even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , <EOS> in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote <EOS> and um i think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . <EOS>
