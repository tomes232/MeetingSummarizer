brilliant . <EOS> very nice . <EOS> for your first powerpoint it's lovely . <EOS> so <EOS> my findings , <EOS> um i just did a preliminary study here <EOS> and uh i found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . <EOS> and too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . <EOS> um too much metal is used sometimes <EOS> and people pick up radio signals and the like , <EOS> and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire <EOS> and injuring the customer , <EOS> just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . <EOS> therefore i suggest primarily plastic construction . <EOS>
