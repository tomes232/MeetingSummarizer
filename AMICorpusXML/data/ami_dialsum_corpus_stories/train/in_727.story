okay okay . <EOS> so my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , <EOS> but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . <EOS> um 'cause i think what we're in <EOS> what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , <EOS> um so i think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , <EOS> i think that would be pushing it . <EOS>
