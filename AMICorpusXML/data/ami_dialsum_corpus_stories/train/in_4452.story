you wanna go to the next slide ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah right away . <EOS> okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? <EOS> and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups <EOS> and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of . <EOS> we can't accept every suggestion of course , <EOS> but maybe we just need to get a few . <EOS> and show the the prototype to consumer research groups , <EOS> we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . <EOS> so we have to get some input from those people . <EOS> and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition <EOS> and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . <EOS> um , next slide please . <EOS>
