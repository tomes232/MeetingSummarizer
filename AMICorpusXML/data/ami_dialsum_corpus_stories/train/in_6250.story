okay . <EOS> and our colour i think is great . <EOS> the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . <EOS> and given um the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible . <EOS> and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality , <EOS> obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else <EOS> so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . <EOS> so i think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . <EOS>
