it's a cool idea but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i'm happy with that . <EOS> completely . <EOS> hu yeah . <EOS> okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the t_v_ itself . <EOS> well you would have to have a button on a t_v_ or on your wall or some place since the t_v_ already has power . <EOS> yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , <EOS> and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the t_v_ it's not gonna work , <EOS> um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . <EOS> sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . <EOS>
