mm-hmm . <EOS> uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . <EOS> if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency <EOS> like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency <EOS> the device should know what the frequency is . <EOS> it should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action <EOS> like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal , <EOS> and the t_v_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control <EOS> and uh so uh i think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices . <EOS>
