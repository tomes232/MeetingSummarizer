hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> would anybody like to go first ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> sure . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so i've been looking at the components design . <EOS> um . mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet <EOS> and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . <EOS> um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . <EOS> um , i assume we'll be custom designing our case , <EOS> probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . <EOS> and we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , <EOS> because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . <EOS> but once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . <EOS> um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the ipod-style wheel . <EOS> the infrared l_e_d_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . <EOS> um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . <EOS> and al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . <EOS> so we have some material options . <EOS> um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . <EOS> um , i'd recommend against titanium <EOS> because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . <EOS> um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . <EOS>
