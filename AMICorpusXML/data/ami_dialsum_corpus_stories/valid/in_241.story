oh shoot . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh just general findings . <EOS> uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , uh some sort of user interface , <EOS> which i think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . <EOS> um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . <EOS> and um <EOS> oops . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> this is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . <EOS> uh this just kinda represents the energy source <EOS> which feeds into the circuit chip <EOS> uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch <EOS> which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between <EOS> so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons . <EOS> um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , <EOS> which will be the part that actually what ? sends signals to the the television . <EOS> and then you've got your happy little t_v_ watcher there . <EOS>
