mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh , okay findings , that's the point that i'm working on currently <EOS> but uh so far i i was uh looking what what are the blue circuit , i mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , <EOS> but the prices i read are high . <EOS> so , i know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves <EOS> because you can you can uh you can make the t_v_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , <EOS> but you know , when you are not close to the t_v_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on <EOS> and so i am i am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of r_w_ <EOS> but we will discuss it later maybe . <EOS>
