yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> my personal preferences . um , <EOS> i think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five . <EOS> mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . <EOS> uh second , i think you will get the most revenue from i from it . <EOS> um , yeah , <EOS> people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of t_v_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder . <EOS> um second point , <EOS> we have to impro improve the most used functions , as i said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . <EOS> third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire , <EOS> uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller , <EOS> so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the t_v_ <EOS> where you can put the the remote control in . <EOS>
