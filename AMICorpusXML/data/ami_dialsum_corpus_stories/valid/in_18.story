yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that . <EOS> uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , <EOS> but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch <EOS> there is a switch uh between these . <EOS> when the switch is pressed in a w on this <EOS> this case it switches a button , <EOS> when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , <EOS> and in uh immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh <EOS> displaying to the user that something has happened . <EOS> that's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . <EOS> or i press button <EOS> but nothing's happening on the t_v_ , <EOS> so is is something wrong or something . <EOS> so that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user . <EOS> uh w well <EOS> the signal goes via chip <EOS> that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals <EOS> and then it's processed <EOS> and then it's sent to the infrared bulb <EOS> where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . <EOS> and those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . <EOS> uh well <EOS> my personal preferences here , <EOS> well <EOS> we have to keep it simple . not too many uh gadgets and functions , <EOS> just like you said <EOS> uh well <EOS> the most users n <EOS> uh you have a lot of buttons <EOS> and you u u use you don't use them , <EOS> so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those . <EOS> uh i i think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . <EOS> so uh <EOS> no input from the television . <EOS> so <EOS> i think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that , <EOS> because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , <EOS> and so <EOS> in order to receive the signals from uh what's on t_v_ and such . <EOS> so <EOS> i figure that would be uh spending too much money and time <EOS> and <EOS>
