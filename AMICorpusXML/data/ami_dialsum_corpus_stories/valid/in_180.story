nice . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um , components of a remote control , okay . we've already kind of gone over this <EOS> but we're gonna have to get into more detail <EOS> and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . <EOS> energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . <EOS> our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium <EOS> so we might have to look <EOS> if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . <EOS> um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . <EOS> basically , it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . <EOS> so that's one possibility <EOS> but i don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . <EOS> so we'll have to look into that . <EOS>
