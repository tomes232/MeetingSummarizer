right , <EOS> my hand is uh different size than yours for example . <EOS> so , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . <EOS> um , one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , <EOS> so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , <EOS> especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a t_v_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . <EOS> and also um you had issues with the batteries running out , <EOS> so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . <EOS> and in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . <EOS> so , in terms of what this thing would actually look like <EOS>
