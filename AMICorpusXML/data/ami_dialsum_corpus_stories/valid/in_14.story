mm-hmm . <EOS> unsupportive ? <EOS> i think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing i would use all the time , <EOS> but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , <EOS> maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text . <EOS>
