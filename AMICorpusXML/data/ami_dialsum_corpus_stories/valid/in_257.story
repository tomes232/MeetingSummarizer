mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh a diode , a transistor , a resonator , <EOS> these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . <EOS> a battery <EOS> uh , i would like to suggest one thing <EOS> uh if we <EOS> uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , <EOS> even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much . <EOS> it it it's not a high voltage battery . <EOS> then also we can if it is a rechargeable one , then uh people can use it for a long time , <EOS> so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . <EOS>
