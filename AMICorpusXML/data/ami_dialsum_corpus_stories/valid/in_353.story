yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's true <EOS> but um i don't think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast . <EOS> and so you would need like the t_v_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . <EOS> and i dunno if many channels would do have that . if many t_v_s have that . <EOS>
