okay . <EOS> uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . <EOS> as in they want it to do a lot of good s <EOS> they want it to look like it does a lot , <EOS> and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , <EOS> but they don't care so much , <EOS> you know . <EOS> they want it to be <EOS> that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . <EOS> technology technical technologically innovative . people want it to be that , <EOS> but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . <EOS> so <EOS> like the interface is really important . <EOS> and easy to use , <EOS> it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important i mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . <EOS> people want it i is <EOS> it has to be cooler than easy to use , <EOS> you know , <EOS> if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features . <EOS> and if it's easy to use that's a bonus . <EOS> the fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , <EOS> but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . <EOS> how that relates to a remote control i don't know . <EOS> but i i see <EOS> i come on to that in the next in the next slide . <EOS> spongy . <EOS> i've als i've been saying everything's the new black . <EOS> well <EOS> spongy's the new black as well . <EOS> so <EOS> we have the choice between rubber and plastic . <EOS> if it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then can i skip the rest ? <EOS>
