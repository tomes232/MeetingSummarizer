i know . <EOS> okay . nope . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> here you are . <EOS> jess . <EOS> g oh , geez . <EOS> alright , so <EOS> i'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . <EOS> um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . <EOS> we want it to be simple <EOS> and we want it to be fashionable . <EOS> um <EOS> other <EOS> we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . <EOS> uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , <EOS> so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are <EOS> and make sure that we include that we've included all of those <EOS> and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . <EOS> we have a number of different choices for a design concept um <EOS> and s that's that's something that that i'll show you some examples of <EOS> um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , <EOS> how how <EOS> what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . <EOS> uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , <EOS> making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . <EOS> and of course we also have to make it look cool . <EOS>
