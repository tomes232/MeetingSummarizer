uh-huh . <EOS> any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ? <EOS> i think something that's comfortable to hold <EOS> because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things <EOS> and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto , <EOS> so something that's more comfortable <EOS> that fits in a person's hand better . <EOS>
