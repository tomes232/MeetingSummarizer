mm-hmm , it's about that . <EOS> and that's quite a lot for a remote control . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um well <EOS> my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . <EOS> as you said they come with the t_v_ <EOS> so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , <EOS> so maybe we could think about colour ? <EOS> make <EOS> that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . <EOS> um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , <EOS> so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , <EOS> you know those things ? <EOS>
