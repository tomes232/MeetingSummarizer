hmm . <EOS> um you can have multiple scroll buttons , <EOS> um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , <EOS> but um it's it the technology is there . <EOS> and we can also incorporate an l_c_d_ display in the remote , <EOS> but this will increase the cost . <EOS> um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , <EOS> and the price goes up as we choose each of this . <EOS> if we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . <EOS> all the other fancy interface designs go out the window , i'm afraid . <EOS> um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . <EOS> if you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , <EOS> but it that's what you need if you want the l_c_d_ display . <EOS> and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . <EOS> now <EOS> i don't know what that is , <EOS> but i think they think it's quite important <EOS> and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . <EOS> um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , i have to say , <EOS> but maybe you think that's old technology . <EOS> and well <EOS> i i think we've got two options . <EOS> we can either go for a really cheap model , <EOS> keep all of the costs down , <EOS> um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . <EOS> or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , <EOS> i think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , <EOS>
