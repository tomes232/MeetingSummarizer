mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um , so again you can have a little l_c_d_ light somewhere , the flip thing and <EOS> have i forgotten anything ? <EOS> i don't think so . <EOS> so , as you can see , it's a very very simple design , <EOS> which is one of the things i really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . <EOS> think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , <EOS> although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . <EOS>
