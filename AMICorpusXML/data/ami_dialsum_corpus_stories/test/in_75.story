is that no is that not trends ? <EOS> uh no , uh personally as a marketing expert i don't believe that , <EOS> because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , <EOS> like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . <EOS> some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . <EOS> so you can what shape a person will like . <EOS> so in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . <EOS> and by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . <EOS>
