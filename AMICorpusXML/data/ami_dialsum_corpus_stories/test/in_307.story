our findings , lots of findings , <EOS> i've just summarised some of them here . <EOS> the overall thing which i've i've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , <EOS> so it has obvious design implications there . <EOS> um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . <EOS> eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , <EOS> we were quite surprised by that finding , <EOS> but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . <EOS> um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . <EOS> for example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , <EOS> so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . <EOS> so again there's power implications there . <EOS>
