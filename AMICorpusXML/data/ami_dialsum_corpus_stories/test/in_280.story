okay . <EOS> another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? <EOS> um maybe i could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . <EOS> one would be audio controls , <EOS> one would be video controls , <EOS> and the other one would be a device . <EOS> um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , <EOS> but i think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , <EOS> but i think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a t_v_ is something they see and something they hear , <EOS> um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . <EOS> i mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , <EOS> like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , <EOS> and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . <EOS> i mean it might help with the visualisation . <EOS> and it would actually help with the component build as well . <EOS>
