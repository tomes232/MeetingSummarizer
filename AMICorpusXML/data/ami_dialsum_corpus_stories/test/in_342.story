yeah um . <EOS> i agree with having too many remotes around . <EOS> my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , <EOS> and i don't know how to work half of them um . <EOS> what's important for me , i guess , is that it's easy to use <EOS> and that there's not too many buttons , <EOS> they are not too small , <EOS> you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . <EOS> and one thing i particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . <EOS> um , i think there is a way around that , <EOS> but i know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , <EOS> so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the t_v_ itself , <EOS> and i think that's if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . <EOS>
