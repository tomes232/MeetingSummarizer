the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , <EOS> and i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups . <EOS> the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . <EOS> i mean the basic design i understand will be the same , <EOS> but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example . <EOS>
