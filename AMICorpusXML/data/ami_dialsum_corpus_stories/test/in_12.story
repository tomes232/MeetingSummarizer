change the channels . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh the <EOS> i think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . <EOS> 'cause i know when i um when i use the remote to change the channel i very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . <EOS> i usually use the up and down <EOS> because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , <EOS> so that's just uh it's annoying . <EOS> so i think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . <EOS>
