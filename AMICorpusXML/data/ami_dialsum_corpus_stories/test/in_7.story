transmit . <EOS> uh so this is <EOS> these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . <EOS> uh can you see the black uh , round marks ? <EOS> they they are the circuits . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> next , please . <EOS> and um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . <EOS> uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . <EOS> like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip . <EOS> uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy , <EOS> more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . so that also we can have in a battery , <EOS> uh or we can use solar sells . <EOS> uh . <EOS>
