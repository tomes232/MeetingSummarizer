as you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well . <EOS> anyway um . <EOS> and uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after <EOS> because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . <EOS> whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away <EOS>
