okay . <EOS> i'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , i this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , <EOS> but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? <EOS> you know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . <EOS>
