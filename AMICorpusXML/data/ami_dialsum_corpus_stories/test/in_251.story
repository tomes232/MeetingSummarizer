and she was challenged on that point <EOS> um <EOS> that's right . <EOS> yes . <EOS> but uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . <EOS> the industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue . <EOS> she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . <EOS> should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . <EOS> she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . <EOS> uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , <EOS> and if possible a rechargeable battery . <EOS> uh and of course a circuit board . <EOS> and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification <EOS> and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build <EOS> and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider . <EOS>
