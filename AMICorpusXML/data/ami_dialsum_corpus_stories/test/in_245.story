ah yeah . <EOS> yep . yeah <EOS> i've i've got one at home . <EOS> and you can uh program i think eight different devices in it , <EOS> and you can use it for your television , anything else . <EOS> and it also operates on infra-red , <EOS> so you have to got the little device inside your room , <EOS> and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . <EOS> so that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d_v_d_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your t_v_ on the second floor . so that's a pretty handy um <EOS>
