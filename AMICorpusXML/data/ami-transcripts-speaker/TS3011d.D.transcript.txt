Well, you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button, 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels. You Yes. Uh my name is not name but Uh well, I used the the uh documents. And these uh were the most important criteria. It should be. yeah, that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it. Fancy look and feel. So Uh well appar Yeah, but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet. So Yeah, I think these are the most important criteria. So uh that's about it. Um well, since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway Uh Yay. Is it? Is it fancy? So uh one? Is it uh And w yeah, w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials. So in that way It it's fancy. Okay, and uh was it innovative? Yep. Yeah, and uh So uh also a uh two? Is it easy to use? Well the p the most important function is easy to use. The the zapping, channel switching, volume. But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder. Good question. Uh I'll go uh for the two. Hmm? Huh? Yeah. I yeah. Yeah, two, two, three No. Is it easy to find? Yeah, I agree. No. Uh this this was a most spongy option. Well yeah, it depends, 'cause it's the most spongy we could but yeah.

Well, the basic layout doesn't offem offer much, but the voice recognition could add a lot. So Yeah, depends. Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat Signal. Um I think think a one, 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want, so that's like um Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced. Yeah, but uh with these ratings uh should be about one point s seven, yeah. Ye The prices. I agree. Draws. No. Not really. Oh, I only use it to draw a rabbit, so can't say much about it. No, or the other way around. Yeah. And no added value. At all. So In interesting design. Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling. So Yeah..
