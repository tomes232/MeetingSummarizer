What? Yeah. Yeah. We didn't make any uh Oh in Didn't we just do that? Oh. Hmm? We could. Oops. Yeah. Well uh we made a prototype. We first start with the overall uh This is about the total remote control. We made it green. Yeah. It's a fresh colour. And uh the screen light blue. Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under. And the R_ and R_ logo, it just says R_ and R_ now, but uh Any questions so far? Yeah. Yeah. Oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big, so people know it's there and uh Uh Hmm. You push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a Remote settings, et cetera. Yeah. Yeah. And you could also touch it so that it comes out, and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah. Yeah. Forgot. Uh well, this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen. Uh the numbers, which is pretty straight forward. We put ano an an extra button in. We can erase it, but It's the button where you can switch channels. just when you are one and you go to two, you can or if you go to five, you can go back to one with that button. Yeah, that one, yeah. It has a name. And uh uh we put that in, I thought it would be handy there. Uh this the one number or two numbers button. Below that, the page and the sound. And uh in the middle the the mute. Uh battery indicator. It's it's a bit big. And this is the uh the on off uh knop, the stand by uh knop. Or at least it should look like it. And the options uh of teletext. Huh. Yeah. Well this about it, I think. Yeah. I will put it back on the on the nice green. That's the logo of the Yeah. It's th th right now it's only R_ R_, but uh Yeah. Sorry. Oh full screen, yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well Yeah. It uh oh it's in the background. Oh. Y you should make uh a sideways uh view. It will be, I guess. Oh, we can Oh g I would smart board. Uh can I draw here or uh Ooh. So it would be uh something like this from the side, but with a bit of uh curve here, right? Yeah. So if you v flip it like this. Here's yeah. Yeah. So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger, so that it lays a bit o Yeah, that's a bit of problem maybe. Yeah. I think yeah, the battery should be in here, because it's just nothing, so if you could Yeah. 'Cause otherwise I think i I think it does. I if you don't make it green, then the elder people won't won't like it. Yeah. I think it does. Yeah. I don't know whether older people will use it, but I would make it a two or something. Yeah. Huh? Alright, it's a one. Oh it's a one. Yeah. But it's a one uh Maybe uh Yeah. Well they think it's very true, but uh Yeah, but We should perhaps That not. Yeah. I think it is, because it has an L_C_D_ screen, a mi microphone. It's from rubber. Yeah. It's a one I think. Yeah, because they're right on your screen. So you can use the b the the arrows. They're right on your screen, so I don't know where you'd search. Yeah. Well, I think they are. The options are it uh little bit harder, but if you touch the options then it's uh No they're not, but they're they're they are easy to find. Oh. Yeah. I would say yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can make it a two. Yeah, but you don't have t have to use the button on the right. You can touch it. Yeah. You you can touch options. Yeah. You can touch options and it's comes out. The uh the um Below. It's different. For young people I think it's easy to use. Yeah. I think it's In the entire mankind. Yeah. Yeah, but uh Yeah, but they they don't want the uh extra options, right? So Yeah, okay, but so they could Uh I think it is. If they read a manual. Yeah, alright. Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult. You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition, then you say the question and the answer. And that's everything it does, the speech recognition. Yeah. I think it would make it uh I would make it two. Yeah. Three? Oh. You? Oh. Well Two and a half. Three? No. No. But um I mean, that's definitely one. Oh nee, oh seven is it? It is. Yeah, uh the remote score. It's not overwhelmed. Yeah. Yep. Yes. 'Cause we make them in different colours, so that they uh Yeah. That it that it looks like wood, like something, yeah. Uh I think you can. It it feels like rubber, but Well but then when you scratch it it does come off. So that's a bit Oh we have time. What? Yeah, yeah, it's very spongy. Oh but not it's not very spongy, because it's hard rubber. I think it's a three. Hard but Yeah. You can break it. Yeah. Y yeah, you could you could call it. Yeah, y you can lose it, but it isn't hard to lose. Two. That it's hard to lose? Yeah, it it is there's the it's a six, you think? So it's a two. Yeah, you can lose it, so I don't you can make it a three I It does have an a built in function. Nee. Hard to lose. Oh right. It is hard to lose. Yeah, so then this is it is almost true, so a two. Ooh. Oh. Oh well, it doesn't. I think it will, yeah. Uh well I a a two. It's it's much more younger. Yeah. I think it's a two but Two two two. Let's make everything a two. Younger people. It has What did Yeah. Well that it doesn't. Yeah bu but I think they like the speech. You could call to your uh yeah, and the screen, yeah. Right, that that that those are features. No, aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature, and that you can change the volume is feature, and that you can change the options of the remote, uh uh something like that. Yeah. Those are features. Enough features? Yeah. I think two or three. Yeah. Yeah uh a two a two. Just another two. We like two. Yeah, there's R_ and R_ in front. Uh it's not the colour, so maybe you should make two, but it has R_ and R_. Yeah. Yeah, but not R_ and R_ yellow I think. One d on i it's the colours and the I think it is, but I don't know what you think. And you can navigate easier, because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T_V_ uh remote. Yeah. Let's make a different remote. Well Menu. A two? We only have twos. Uh just twos. One three and a few ones. Two threes. We m mostly have twos, so it's pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. I think so too. We can be happy. Yeah. What is it? It's like a bug or something. A fly, yeah. A f butterfly. Yeah. That's it. Sure. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. Redesign. No. Yeah. Yeah. So we're going to erase features or something. Do you have the cost or uh Let's hope. We're going to be here at eight o'clock. We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock. I doubt it. Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet. No, it was in my uh my information, so uh Yeah. Well, if it doesn't work I want to fill it in, but uh But you should uh direct The number of We've got a battery, one or t two batteries, or not? nee one battery, with two small batteries. Yeah. I would do a battery we do. Right? A battery. One battery, right? Electronics, simple chip advanced chip, right? Yeah, so this one and this one. Uh we ha we have um single what? Are we? Oh yay. The single. Oh the the it's not going to work uh people. We have rubber. Thirteen? With a scroll wheel, right? Is he integrated? No, eh? I don't know. Oh yeah, right, we want it to it's not it's not no. Yep. Fifteen, oh, too bad. Oh but with special colour we have. A special form, right? Oh, we don't have any buttons, so Yeah, we need to uh No, uh we have fifteen and oh, right. We could lose the curve. Yeah, I would lose the curve. But you can't push it, so you have to tap. Yeah, alright. So normal scroll wheel? And I think we should lose the curve. Yeah, but if you would i it is a new feature, it it's something special. No, the curve doesn't really No, then it will won't uh stand up from the table. Then it would just Yeah. So We would lose this one? Yeah, we could s yeah, a bit. Sixteen point three. So we still Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something? No? Ma y you just can't do that, or uh We changed th Yeah, and the single curved to uncurved. No. Yeah, but it's t Yeah, but it is uh it it is a new feature, it is something special. I don't know. Yeah, that's difficult. Yeah. Uh. We could make it titanium instead of rubber. Oh. Oh can I ask something? What is special colour? Is that the wood uh wood uh this, we have to have that one too? Th then we still have too much if we use the uh Yeah, we we scrap that one? See, a po three. We need point three. Uh it's a colour. Don't make it wood. Make it uh Yeah, but it's it's special colour, is it a all kind of colours? It's also green or uh Yeah, but it's a special colour than just rubber colour. You have to add something to the rubber to make it green. You don't say here's green rubber. Yeah, you can, you should you have to lose No, it is the scroll wheel, I guess. A push, yeah. Switch colours. It was such a great idea. What do you mean? Oh. But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour, 'cause you have to add it. Yeah, so you always lose the special colour. You co you could make it always black, like normal remote. Oh right, yeah. Yeah, we should u Yeah. We have to make this like four or five or something. That's what it means. Yeah. Oh right, yeah. Is it per remote? Yeah. Yeah, that's right, and you one colour per remote. So then it is one. No. One. So it would be curved, single curve. Or not? So y you just can't make a nice remote. It's too bad for the speaker. Should we change that tha that that's a one if not, or not? Could you copy it? And make it uh The entire uh Perhaps you can then copy page or so. Ooh. No. Oh you you made the entire could you Oh not Well. Would you? By the Perhaps you can save this one, and then copy or something. Add it copy page. Select all. Alright, something went wrong. It doesn't work. Let's forget. Yeah. Oh ignore that. Well, so Too bad. Yeah. The microphone. Yeah. A and we changed something, I guess, or not? We Oh no. Yeah, I tried to copy that one, but it didn't work. So we could fix it like tha that it's like this. You could select it all, but then you can't erase. Erase. When you saw th li uh Earlier when we selected it, w I couldn't erase anything. Just tap somewhere. Yeah. I don't think I can, but uh we can try. Oh, yeah, no, ha-ha. Yeah, we tried it earlier. It's very much work. Yeah, goodbye mic. Oh, I already erased half of the line. Too bad, oh. Like this? Still looks nice. Oh, that's erase. Yeah, that's a bit weird. Oh, now I'm line. Yeah. No, it's weird. Yeah. Bu but stressful. You think, no, my presentation isn't ready. Yeah. Yeah, you had information I didn't have and then uh Oh right. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah, you could Yeah. I think so too. Yeah, but then you can work together too when A chat would also be uh Well, I I don't really like the board, it doesn't really work great. Sometimes I think. It does work, but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh Yeah. Yeah. But Well it is useful, but it doesn't really work all the time. Th the pen doesn't The line is a bit off. Yeah, you can point to where you want the line to be. But Yeah. Yeah. I I I used it, it it was you can use it, it's quite handy I think. Yeah, I used it to y to Yeah, it did work pretty well. I don't think why you would want to use it actually, but it it does work. Yeah, and then you can show it to everybody. It doesn't really write normally. It's a bit Yeah. I think it was great, yeah. Yeah, but it was because we didn't uh Yeah. I thought it was good, but uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well. Yeah. And you get get stuff from the from the computer, but Yeah. You just sit there for ten minutes. Yeah, where is that email? Oh did you? Is it on there? Is it on there? I didn't find the didn't look but uh I didn't look, but I got like one email after ten minutes or something. That's what we said. And it not a lot uh No, the first one. I didn't know uh nee. And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here, so I went, right. Yeah. Just looking at the screen and uh Yeah, an Yeah, that will be handy. Yeah. Yea uh so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic, or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen, when you look at that. Yeah. Uh, I dunno. Think that's about it. Hmm. Heavier um less heavy laptops. Yeah. But that's not really uh Yeah. Yeah, everything worked. Yeah, but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone. Then it pops up pop up screen came. Five minutes in the meeting. No. Huh. You did? Well Oh, right. Well Yeah. Champagne. Yeah. Do we get another email? I I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again, but We do? Yeah. Uh th that that one? You can just Yeah, but it's it isn't a picture or, well, is it? No, isn't possible. But you can make a screen shot, I think. Yeah. Uh oh, export. Images. How big do you want the images? Yeah. This one? This one? Um Well it isn't on the desktop. You can only save it in my documents. Oh. Oh, alright. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Three. Can we stay here? Yeah. Yeah, alright. Why can't we stay here? Yeah.
