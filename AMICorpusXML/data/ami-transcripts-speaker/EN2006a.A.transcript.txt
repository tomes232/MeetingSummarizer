Right. 'Kay. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. He has had it certainly. Yeah. Yeah, he's been emailed it while ago. Now he's gone. Oh really? Excellent. We should have these things in our area. You know, we don't have high-tech things. Well, I guess there's telescopes, but that that's that's different though, isn't it. That's not no. Yeah, that's right, although you oh it isn't actually used all that often these days, I think. Gosh. Right, aye. Right. Gosh. And you miss all the the body language and things. Yeah, yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Oh. Right. Gosh. Yeah. Yeah. That's very artificial though, isn't it? Yeah. Not very sensible. Yeah, right. Yeah. That must be really weird. Is there? Gosh. Yeah. Gosh. Well Mm-hmm. Great. Do you think? Sorry, I I shouldn't intervene probably. But well the um isn't it that if um it's a region of the spectrum that's u and we can point at it. And then it is a sp a sp spectral f f feature, and that isn't You think? Okay, alright. Okay. Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a feature. Um because in the s sp spectrum it does that and it does that. So it yeah. That's that is where it breaks. So yeah. Oh, you want to s split that one and, do you, into two? Yeah. Yeah. Uh I'd agree with that, I think. Yeah. Thanks. But if it had been there, um you would've had it as a feature. Yeah, because you haven't actually listed explicitly um that you're not going to include it. L line ratio is after abundances. So Oh, I see what you mean. Um Well No. Yeah. Um Well, I mean you could look at this this spectrum and spot that um th L Lyman alpha has been damped.. That is a n spectral feature. Oh yeah. No, that's true. Different redshifts. Yeah yeah yeah, that's true. Yeah, but But you're guessing in a way though, aren't you? So Mm that's a that's a tricky one, certain certainly. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you have all of it? Right, well th yeah, th that's in the the manual. So I g I guess it is. I And that it is altering the spectrum, isn't it? I mean is a ch change in the s spectrum of background objects. Uh is that right? Yeah. No. Yeah, I think so too in that M That's actually an ionic species, isn't it actually? Not a a spectral feature as such o on its own. No. B b why aren't you marking it then? Uh-huh. Well, that's p what I'm p pondering really. Um Yeah, but this is um species of cloud, it's a p a particular species of cloud, not just a general cloud, isn't it? So isn't that different? Okay, th Then I guess not then. Yeah. And But it's in this s sp sp sp sp spectrum of another object though. It it isn't the spectrum of the clouds. Yeah. That is true. Uh and he could point at it, that's true, and say that is Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah. I'm not sure actually. I th I think I would mark it. And And that it It is a region of the spectrum and they're actually using a region of the spectrum as the data. Um But if you both want not to mark it, then fine, don't mark it. Mm. Right. You have to s speed up. We'll go p could be here all day. Well I y Yeah, I don't think you can. Yeah, uh I don't think that's a feature. Really? It's a process, isn't it? Well Isn't that a process? It's a process, isn't it? Well it I wouldn't have any of it, I think. I think all of that is um just that is process. Isn't it? Yeah. You think? Um You don't think that it Actually is abundance really in a way. I'm not sure. But I'm not sure. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Uh i Well, but it Isn't this an elemental um abundance that you estimate actually using a number of lines? Is it it isn't just one discrete line in the spectrum, is it? B I'm not sure. Well if you t Two is an ionic species and it'll have a number of Lines in the spectrum, and you'll uh estimate On the abundance all of the s species actually use the old lines. They haven't been if it's yeah. I think so, yeah. Oh well, what's new. Okay. Well, then have it in. Yeah, yeah, okay. What does that mean? Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Sorry, what's the I can't see. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't I think now probably. Well H_ L_ was a line there really, isn't it. So Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah, exactly that. Yeah, exactly that. Yep. Technique. Yeah. The network is an instrument though, isn't it. It It's E_V_N_, isn't it? Well it Isn't all of This is an instrument if you have it all, isn't it? I think so. Yeah. But um Which it is, uh I think. That's what I think. Oh, I think it's uh um s s s starting with um Eu European I think. Uh yes. Just in Europe. But it's actually Merlin and all the i um international logs in Europe, all hooked up into one instrument basically. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Did you? I thought it was a process and that it it wasn't included. Yeah. Yeah. Really? Well I would argue about that,you see, because I think that I mean th that you only extract that after you actually model a sp spectrum, don't you? Yeah. But, have a component though as such. Yeah, g um c Yeah, that's that's what I'm thinking, that It's actually really um after you actually model the s a spectrum, not just actually looking at the spectrum. Yeah, you think? Y Yeah. Yeah, but um component it is m means it's an element actually in the model though. Well uh The excesses, yeah. But um the component isn't. I think I would. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I I think actually pretty early on I'd have thought Where are they? Uh only just i Interesting because on the hour it yeah. No. No it is yeah. Well people do though, don't they? I mean it's pretty s stupid, but they do. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. If you're having ultra-loom this early on, then I think you have to have here. I don't think so. But t y are you arguing not to have anything with object in it though? So there goes And you s speed it up as well I think. So
