Yeah. Could you ju just quickly rewind? Yeah. Okay. Oh. Okay. Okay. Oh. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No no. Wait wait. It's going very fast for me actually. thing actually. It's very fast. So wha first point the first thing you told me that you took the slides and you was and you had a l big dictionary and you are seeing uh what what are the inside the slide, right? Uh what the 'cause I first statement I could not understand. Uh when you said the the st uh uh the s uh the w yeah, so we what's so yeah, so could you please tell me little bit more in detail? Yeah. No no no, don't go that. I I want the no, I want to understand what did you mean by the wo uh the te uh thing like saying that I took a dictionary and then a word from the slide and what you are looking for. I could not understand clearly clearly that. Mm mm-hmm. Okay, but do how do why do you want certain words. Like wha how do you expect that certain words? Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It appears in almost uh uh it is if it appears in all the slides it says a hundred percent correlation for me. One percent well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are like that. Okay.. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, it's independent of each other. Okay. Okay, fine, that's fine, that's uh uh uh s certain words it should. You have to Okay. Fine. Now I'm uh okay. I'm into the loop. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Context. But it is implemented on the A_S_R_? Or uh where? Okay. Okay. Oh okay. Yeah. Else interpolate, extrapolate. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you mea so uh you mean to say that um like when one case you were saying that if you include the context and all those thing it helps in your A_S_R_ improvement, but it doesn't, which more subjective I think this whole Yeah. Uh-huh. Yes. Yeah. Mm. Mm yeah, you can do that, yeah. Or it could Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So you so you so okay. So maybe like it can be uh something like in a meeting it can be like an unusual scenario for you, in a presentation with a slide. And the unusual scenario that you're not using the uh slide at all. Mm-hmm. Yeah. What are the other slide, yeah. We have plenty of things to do. What track? Yeah. Go on. Yeah, it's no problem. Okay. So uh well so ultimately now the next step what is that? Because I want like kind of a uh so at first you said that okay now you did this. This correlation studies. And they show that there's a very less correlation or in fact no correlation kind of thing. And uh um uh so uh so what next in on top of it what you are going to build I mean is the question now. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, so t I mean to the different direction now that's what I mean to say. What you like to take from there. Uh it's not defined yet, okay. Mm-hmm. But what kind of problem? We need a definition of some kind of uh problem, right? Uh yeah.. Yeah. No, no, no. No but yeah, direction. Yeah, that's that is a thing. We go on to the next direction. It should not that i it should not happen that you're doing so many things and ultimately it doesn't goes into a thesis. The that's that should not the problem. Your thesis should be w in one direction. One problem. And uh should go uh in one or uh one d yeah. It it doesn't make sense. Uh the it may be good as a C_V_ for you, but then as a thesis you will have problems uh defending it and all those things. So what is that uh what would be the next possible direction you want to take. Uh Error measure. It's yeah. Yeah, exactly. Mm. S see that is going to tell us uh something like uh wha the thing is that i uh it it see you can totally go into the text domain and be there, you know? It can be s no problem. But as long as uh it is okay. But if you want to do with uh s like certain something with the speed and all those things together then it's a different scenario. Uh you may not want to work on all the problems. Someone may work on some other problem. But then you you make use of that to extend your work in some. And uh and as I also t it depends like also like I think if uh boss is interested in working in both speech and text, you can understand very well. That part is also there. No, the boss. Like have a it's like instead of saying like you should like work on both side, you know, the text and the speech aspect of it. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh w one thing interesting is what we came up in the discussion also you about telling that uh detecting such scenarios where there is no relation between the slide and the person talking, that may be one good starting point for you actually. And then at that point y uh you detect something like that and then you show something like uh what you are saying that i if there is uh if uh there i if it is out of discussion, the words are no way are going to help your recognition anyway, A_S_R_. But if it is more on the um the slide information is not going to help you. But uh if it is uh if it is related to the sli what he is giving a presentation on the slide then you show the your A_S_R_ if you detect this even then you can show that how where you can really help or not help. Because you say there's no correlation now. But then here it comes that there at some point there might be a correlation there. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. So okay.. Mm-hmm. Mm. Oh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The th sides and the talk. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Like another mic. Th yeah, most of the most of the time you have the title to do, no. The AMI dat the AMI data what that like that only most of the time you knew they had the word. The word you are going to present. Everyone is presenting the same set of slide. Yeah. What about M_L_M_I_? W the one we collected last year. Audio is very bad, right? Yeah. uh one single channel or at least a closed channel collection, no. Okay, okay, okay. It was good. Tha tha tha that Uh okay. So they are is there are still using that uh desktop microphone or what over there. Or Uh Ah. Okay. Okay. That's fine, yeah. Yeah. It's a. Yeah it's a Yeah, I understand. Okay, so now there be uh would be some time wh what is we should be getting a time recording system, right? That uh uh uh so Mm. Okay. Lapel. Should be okay. No, it it's it's uh quite a bit, yeah, problem, to do that kind of thing. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, but probably we were the f you know, the post uh the the thing is somewhere projector. Suppose there's like the the white-board or whatever, the presentation is over there, the speaker is more probably is going to this way or that way. So probably you you may not need a very big microphone either. Probably one or two. uh uh ye uh yeah. Uh yeah. Hmm. Yeah. No the they the the the CHIL may be interesting for you. But it's a l uh well yeah, it may be interesting for your problem, I think. Y yeah. No no no. Yeah. Yeah, it's more like TAM. But uh yeah. The the their collection is much uh uh like they have uh R_T_N_s and all those thing. People sitting and uh it's a lec it's a lecture uh a meeting collection. And I uh is it through n n uh L_D_A_ or something. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So so probably we can yeah. CHIL may be interesting actually. You can look at it. In the text. Mm. Well but uh S Yep. Hmm. Mm-hmm. That's that's a yeah. That that they have. Mm. They're talking fast. I had a problem I like find the answer for my own. Yeah. So what about the figure things? What happens if there's a figures coming on the slide? So what do you want to do with that? On the s uh-huh. Either stop it Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Usually in products and resources. Okay, so what are you going to do between the data when you collect and this? What do you want to do now? By the time you get the data it's going to take another two months if I am right, the whole capturing system when it is going to come. So what is the next step? Yeah, you have to submit it in like two months also again. Yeah, yeah, to submit, yeah. It's one year, right?. For sure. You you need it bad. Call routing where. That's inte. I think we should yeah. This is yeah. Uh h oh. Yeah. Mm yeah. Mm yeah. Uh uh Uh yeah. Yeah. Even if little bit of. Oh. This Uh ye yeah. Yeah. No no, I think you yeah, it's uh it's huge. Yeah. It it it's non-determinist. Yeah, that's what we expect to Yeah. Exa that's the intention there. Sure. Mm ye. No, no, no, no, no. It i Yeah. Surely they should they should have had that actually. So maybe like we had to do this end point detection and probably a little bit of final filtering. And then I think you should be pretty much converging to the system. But the still the reason with the the they had like what are the systems we train on databases are they are chop neatly. That there is not too much silence beginning, not too much silence at the end. They are they are j they they chopped so neatly for the it like custom made database. But uh here it's not like that you know like uh-huh. Yeah. There are the several things. Like one thing is like we can do this begin and end detection, as we said. Or you and he can uh we can try to use uh France Telecom's uh approach actually. And that um uh uh they they have this front end which uh uh which which can do a spectral. And plus it can give you a voice activity detection. Part f part from basis it can give. So somethi we can just yeah, we can just run it quickly and see. And probably you will have to run it. Will give you the idea that is it okay like? Yeah. No no no no. Uh not running, I mean to say p probably uh he should run it or uh like we can ge help him to run it actually. Because at some point he has to get into Uh I mean to say I I mean to say that it's okay. We have all the scripts. But probably uh he should run it I mean to say. It's a The all these experiments probably Uh the they are uh the scri because up to uh probably maybe we shall do mm it yeah. Uh for to make it faster we should ru it run maybe. If we run f we ourself it it's very fast. Uh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm okay. No, but I mean to say that if you if you if you if you if you give him the scripts and ask him to run, uh the Uh no. Yeah. But it's Uh Yeah. Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that uh-huh. No no no no, I the end point system is different thing, no? That's and we need it for AMI plus other thing. And so but the I am to all saying yeah. I I am. It's n it uh no no no, it's not speech non-speech. Uh uh it's uh it's uh it's yeah. Yeah. Any anything nonsense or else it beeped. It's not silent. It's uh you can say that's very yeah. And it can be it can be anything. Yeah. Breathing. Yeah. No anyway, so we okay, so we'll finish this call routing stuff. What do you say all thi this is okay with you, right? So we'll k because I think uh it it it has not been even submitted outside also the work what Jean-Yves did yet. Mm yeah not done that yet. Tried Uh yeah, he still yeah. Uh-uh. Yeah. So yeah, it it's pretty much good time also, no? And he c he can and uh when do you intend to start writing the proposal? Probably you should start, I think. S slow. Little bit start thinking. No no, you you should not wait till the end. That's what I mean to say. Uh yes,. Because you Because it Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh. Yeah, it can go there, yeah. See No, no, no. I think it's uh it's good if he submits his pr proposal. As a research report you put here, submit it for the conference. It's quite good for the proposal directly. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think uh we we may have to like it can have a uh it's it's kind of like uh uh maybe take like uh uh two or three days, you know, like to sit out and say uh one converge to one approach and then just do without that yeah. And probably yeah. So that is the thing. We have to sort out the bug kind of thing and see how reliable is this end point detection for us. Yeah, mm-hmm. Uh yeah, I think uh then we can go back to C_T_S_ actually. Yeah. Okay. And uh yeah, so that is this. So you wanted to talk something more than that. Well we obstructed you with that. You wanted to talk something different also. No. Or maybe another meeting. And then I say I don't remember.. No, I was just looking this. Okay uh we are not out of time, you know. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's happened uh it happened with my friend. Like uh he was taking pictures pictures pictures and it was going thirty seven, thirty eight, forty even.. So I said there's some problem with yours uh your uh uh the way he uh put the roll inside. There is some problem, it has got stuck somewhere. It can never go to forty one, forty Yeah, I uh uh thirty seven, thirty eight is fine. forty, forty one is but see, he has already. Don't listen. Okay.
