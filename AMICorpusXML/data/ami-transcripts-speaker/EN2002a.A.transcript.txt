Wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings. Yeah. Not a lot. No. Hmm. Okay. Sounds like you've done some stuff. So 'Kay. Hmm. Hmm. Everything. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To just have the sort of main same sort of idiom throughout kinda. So Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. But then it's not as extensible. Like if we wanna add more things in the future, then we have to well, new buttons. I don't know. Whereas a menu type thing is more flexible that way. But We're probably not gonna be adding too many things. Okay, exactly. I know, I know. True, true. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Actually, Yeah, but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well. I mean speaker characterisation tied into I don't know. Di Just some way to sort of leverage that information. Like we have it, we're doing it, but what how does it help the browsing? Or what can it give us in the browsing? Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Right. Yeah. True, yeah. Is that just from the main main window? Is that is that from any particular window, like if we wanna sorta get like if we were on the users versus like topic or something, have a right-click from for these various things to yeah. Right, yeah. Yep. Okay, yeah. Now it's consistent throughout. So, yeah. Right. Actually yeah, like um another common thing, like if we have it so it's set up that um if you double-click and it goes to a default thing on the menu, I mean that's kind of a typical kinda action that would happen. If you double-click on a particular topic or something, then it goes to sort of a like a default view, so it'll be like all the um cases of that topic, either whatever we decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting, and just show up the the particular instances of that topic in a meeting. Like I'm just thinking to have the default there, so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that's the most common thing that's gonna happen, so the double-click will do that and so save them the trouble of right-clicking and choosing the item on the menu. Well, it might come to us as we start playing with it. Um like we have the the right-click menu. You'll have the menu, right-click it, but instead of like have a default double-click, so if there's a de so it'll be a choice from the menu but yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, exactly. Well then they close it. Yeah. You know, it's not it's not the end of the world. Yeah,. Yeah. Okay.. Hmm. Mm. Well, yeah. Mm-hmm. I think we probably need that, though to have the f the full flexibility, we need to have that there, but um yeah. Mm-hmm. Although the thing is typically though, is someone gonna have five windows open at the same time, probably not. Probably just two or two or three of whatever whatever they're looking at, like dialogue acts, to whatever, characterisations. Hmm. Yeah, true. Hmm. So like have a tab there? For something like that choose on choose one. Yeah. Oh you should be able to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, or even just have buttons on it, toggle buttons or something on the tool-bar for that window. Just something. A lot of different ways we can do it, it doesn't doesn't have to be a tab or whatever. Just gonna be yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Or check-marks. Even have two of 'em checked and send Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. True. Oh yeah? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, like a lot of these can be, like once we get the disfluencies out, then we can you know, have transcript without the disfluency, transcript with the disfluent disfluency. Have all these, you know, have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of and probably mutually um whate distinct, yeah. Exclusive, yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Right. Yeah, that kinda makes sense. By the end of February. Okay, right. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, so we can plug it in and Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Actually is the code accessible, like the the GUI stuff that you've done, yeah. Like can we just like copy like the latest stuff out of your directory, somewhere? Or Like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something, try and just plug some stuff I think you can if Well, if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable, then we c know the directory to get in then and just That might be might be an idea. Yeah. I think by default they are I think really? Or Yeah. Okay. Okay, alright. Okay. Or you could just email to us. Okay, yeah, yeah, okay, right. Yeah, right, okay. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Lower case. Yeah. Hmm. Right. Um all the searching stuff. Like the the in inverted file stuff and um the next search query and all that. Hmm. Yeah. So you could probably just use that code, like that was behind the question she asked him earlier. Just You know, the re-using code and stuff was just like okay, good. Um apparently Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, probably. We'll probably still have to do some other file manage while, I don't know, creation. Messing around still, though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Hmm. Yeah. Huh? Okay. Right. Okay. Right. Yeah, it's good idea. Yeah. Mm-hmm, libraries. Hmm. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly, exactly. So you're still working? I see. Yes, exactly, same. Yeah, I mean betwe um I sup yeah. Yeah. Right. Well well you're in S_P_N_L_P_ and S_P_ two, right? So yeah. Yeah, that's where I'm at. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, that's fun. Oh yeah. Okay. So. Yeah, I was thinking that we can probably get uh start attacking this seriously and then just um, yeah, hopefully have something by next week that we can sorta try integrating into the GUI. Okay. Think that should be possible. Okay. Why? Hmm. Well they did say it wasn't the most efficient. Very clearly, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hmm, right, right. Yeah. M yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, seriously, on the weekend. Yeah. Well f Uh Um Yeah. Yeah. How many hours is this? Hmm. Yeah, seriously. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I gotta work on. Mm. Who was doing that? Oh really? Damn. Yeah, yeah. These can be changed as well. Okay, yeah. Um I don't know, it doesn't matter. If if you want to. I mean it's just, you know, play around with some extra stuff. You have some time, why not. Hmm. Was that in informatics course? Or Oh. Oh, it like digital, okay. Okay. Yeah. Hmm. Alright. Yeah. Fine. Hmm. Yeah. I'll be happy when this week is over. Yeah. Well I don't know, is that about it then or anything else we need to discuss? Did we wanna meet before we talk to Steve next week. Well, I dunno. We'll probably get some work done over the weekend, so I dunno if after D_N_L_G_ or something, maybe just have a little quick little update and just Yeah. Well we can decide. Yeah, exactly. True. Yeah. Search. And well sure, why not. Couldn't be that hard. Well, it'll be, you know, still limited version of, you know, the next query search. But, no no. Won't be the whole thing then. Um like we can just decide sort of things that we do wanna do. Hmm. yeah. Well, actually most are just dialogue acts. And what else was there.. summary topic Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it'll get behind schedule, yeah, pretty quick. Like you're saying, yeah. Well actually, do we wanna set a date for interim prototype? Specifically a date? Yeah. Okay. Is it semblance of reality. Yeah. I see. Right, true. Mm decide on that on over the weekend. Yeah. Right. Yeah, totally. Oh, just like the basic. So like no. Sorry? Yeah. Just like all the and seeing the code, and just sort of how just see the basics of what you've done. Like just get a a quick look over and just the basics. Yeah. Or like like, you know, the class paths all that sort of thing. Like just just say okay, well here's you know, everything's basic in set-up and then just yeah, just jump right in. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. In the morning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Well thing is, you know, if yeah, something like that could happen anytime 'cause uh yeah, like my schedule's like a class, break, class, break, class, you know, that sort of thing. So so yeah, I know, exactly, exactly, that's what I'm thinking. So something like that and then if I have a class I can run off and do whatever. Yeah. Okay. Actually Monday, Monday might be good d um. Yeah, yeah. Anytime um, not at n not at noon or two or four. No, in between those is you know, like one or three or Sure. Possibly. Yeah. Yeah, that's an option too. Yeah, after. Sure. That's fine. Yeah. Or three thirty. No, just yeah. That'd be necessarily necessarily short. Actually we can't get in there though. W we well we can get in through the through the the card the card door. Yeah. How about if we take uh a tour? Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay. Just sort bang on it. Actually I was asking Steve about that, whether we can get in there. Whether he was gonna get us access into the the computer room. Yeah, print Okay. Right. Is there a printer in there too? A nice okay. That would come in handy, yeah. Hey, we could we could photo-copy our um assignment if we wanted to. Yeah. Well the comments I'm thinking. Um Yeah, that's true. So after D_N_L_G_. Yeah. As long as D_N_L_G_ doesn't go late. Oh. So Sounds like me. Are you? Next week? Or the week? How? Oh. Yeah. That's cancelled? Oh really? Hmm. Um something like that. I think one or couple classes were cancelled. Yeah. Exact Yeah. I th Yeah. I think it was up to the professor whether they did it or not. Well, I don't feel like teaching. Yeah, okay. I think yeah. I think D_I_L_ will probably have one to make up for missing classes. D_I_L_ will probably have classes, yeah. Yep. You can have it. Yeah. Huh? Which one, the top one? Um Do you really want multiple windows from a single lap? But most will probably want to go with defaults. Yeah. Yeah. You'd be s Yeah, exactly, and just the other comment about whether you wanna do both speaker characterisation and topic segmentation. Yeah, yeah that's about it. Nothing terribly exciting. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Okay. So Okay. Yeah. Okay.
