It might be a problem for me at the stage right now because I based everything on not having those um Yeah. Uh what I also Yeah, what I also did was having two people um annotate the first meeting, and so they didn't annotate the n n uh uh the spaces and everything would mess up. I think if I had spaces for the um new values so when I went to do correlation it wouldn't work anymore. So I don't know. Oh what I could do is um work um further with um what I've got now and then just when I have my um um yeah, the final formula ready, I could uh t apply to the new stuff. That would be okay. Um No, my um yeah, what my um T_F_I_D_F_ is based on Colin's data. So um I end up with the same. Yeah. Is it still the old old T_F_I_D_F_? Oh, okay. Hmm. Yeah. I think so too. How about the summarisation again, you wanted to base it on sentence length as well, and I've got a sentence length incorporated into my importance measure at the moment. So Okay. But if we do it twice, it wouldn't make too much sense. Don't know how exactly we will want to implement your We can. Are we still with that idea that we want to display bars for the individual speakers? Okay. And also displaying the speakers before an utterance. Okay. So Toby, you wanted to uh have keywords for each topic segment or something? Um who would uh who uh provides the values for that? No one. Right. Because what I do is um having um values for each segment at the moment. So I could just extract the highest ones for each segment. I don't know if that's good or bad. It could be at least I could provide some value. Uh it it doesn't matter to me. I could do both. Okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Especially when the segments are really long. Mm.. At least their names, and if we have their names then we can get their email. Mm.
