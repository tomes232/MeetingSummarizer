Cheers. It should be this one here. Do you reckon this stands for lambda or yeah, okay. I forgot to keep track of the overall score, like who wins and who lose. Mm-hmm. Well, w within the sentence that you sort of currently looking at um feel free to correct it that way that you'll do you know like it's not only about resolution but it's sort of like coming up with a corrected version based on these, yeah. Have you do you've seen that there are the other one there, the quasar, right? The uh right, sorry. Mm-hmm. Oops, no. Or actu actually sorry, I think um the um this cut up page continues in the next side. Yeah. Characterised by unusually No, is it? Hmm. Yeah. And give it an acronym. G_B_H_C_, ooh. get this out of the way. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Wait, fr from the linguistic side, if you if you mark star burst before and if you feel that star bursts are like objects, then I think it sh it should stay in in this case, even though it's modified by activity, or it's it's m modifying activity actually. Hmm. Is is goo again or is it really Z_ equals two? Mm-hmm. Alright. Mm-hmm. If it was radio-loud quasar, then you would mark it as one thing?

The the uh w wasn't it that according to the uh acronym rule, the first one? Mark the la la. Mark the whole string as one entity. One acronym. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. What what's this N_ thing? Because that is not marked in the No, sorry, I mean the um so so most the Right. Hmm. Yeah. But Yeah. But it's s so you're mostly settling uh settling for for the uh solution where you mark all contacts individually. Right. Something that you can point to, right? Or Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh, I see. So in that sense it's like like a derived property. Yeah, I see, uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Hmm. Sorry, what what happened now? So you you f you found that dwarf amorphous blah blah galaxies, that that's not a proper name? But you still include the acronym? Or Oh okay. Alright, okay. I see, mm-hmm. Hey, wow. Under two hours.
