Great, thank you. Yep. Sorry, mm yep. Yeah. Uh yes, course, of course it is, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think it all is yeah, I think it is all m one name. Yep. Yeah, these are s s species ions again, not individual lines. It's not a competition. Uh Yeah, and this one. Um Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well it's one of them out um over here I think actually at the moment. So 'cause our sun is a is a T_ dwarf. Mm-hmm. Uh Well it's a process though, isn't it. Isn't it a process? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't have that. Well I think y bu y y you can actually mark it if it isn't altering what's in the manual. Uh um it's only altering earlier rules. That aren't allowed. Yeah, then then do, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Y yeah, yeah, but yeah. Yeah. Just a p what are you doing there there, sorry? Yep. Isn't remote. Yeah, fine. Um yeah, that's actually marked ex explicitly in here not to have A_ bar clusters. So yeah. No, I I'm I'm not arguing. I agree, yeah. Do you want this one here? No? Conti continuum. No, okay. I think that's a s species again. Yeah, I think you have. Yeah. Well n I think I would actually leave it um with only th on those Br broad l Line in it. Um because I think that's s what you have been doing earlier on. Yeah? Yeah? No. The difference only weak line, isn't it? Oh yeah. There's a line there as well. It's different. And an and. Different as well. They just made that up. That's yeah, exactly. That's not a source type. That's we did earlier anyway. So No, they just made that up as well. No. That's a process though. Yeah, it's a process or a source. I'm sorry. Yeah. Well hang on though. But wasn't there one just a minute ago in which only had a line? But you just Keeping lines there. So Adjective. Uh yes. Right. Okay, okay. Okay. Yeah, okay, fine. Yeah. Yeah. That has to go as well then, surely. A star burst is a class. As is an A_G_N_. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um are they uh if you say so. Okay. Okay. Well you haven't been earlier, have you? I don't think you were. Uh Have you? Oh okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I think so. Uh No. High velocity clouds. There. That's right. Why? Y yes, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Uh Really? If it was Are you? N No. No. Nor weak emission then. No. Oh yeah. Sorry. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Um m uh y ye well, I don't know. Yeah. But Hmm. That's the actually usually. But anyway. I don't mind. Yeah. I gue I guess keep it then. Yeah, I think so. Blended ion lines, yeah. Yes, you do mean ion lines. Yeah. No. Yeah, it's if it has h h Hydrogen or h helium in the atmosphere of white dwarfs. Yeah. No, that's right. That all goes. Yeah. I guess you could keep it then. Yeah. But it's a region though, isn't it. Ye ye the N_ as well. Uh yeah, Right. Yeah. Well kind of, it it's uh uh d if you had a s sp spectrum, you have all the l lines of actually lots of different elements, and you have to work out at all the ones sp which are ion lines. Then after that you look and say um ha has a lot of ion in it. Um But b yeah i That's right, it's it yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. I think so. Yeah. Really? Really? You think? Okay, if you both think so. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Well hang on though, but um Is it just um to s scrub your mechanism there? It isn't uh a spectral feature such as oh, it's a process. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think it's a process myself. Yeah. Well that's true. That is true. Yeah. Yeah, okay, okay. I guess keep it probably, yeah. No, they've made that one up certainly. I've never heard of that one before. No. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I wouldn't, yeah. I think all of that goes then, doesn't it? Surely. No. No, I don't think anybody goes. Yeah. Mm no. It's an instrument, yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's it. Hurray. Well, very good. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's it, isn't it? We're done? Right.
