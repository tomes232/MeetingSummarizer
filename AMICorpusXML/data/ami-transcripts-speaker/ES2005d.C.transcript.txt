Okay. We'll sta I'll use the PowerPoint, I guess. How was that, was that fun? Okay. Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes, but I will do. Upsidaisy. Um Um we Yeah. Alright, okay, yeah. He's gonna get his pen. Um Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news? Uh we have budget problems. I'm afraid you're all sacked. Oops. I don't even have this on. Okay, have you got a presentation to make? No. Okay so it's just your your show. Three? Oh. Tomato? What tomato? I don't recall a tomato. Ah I see, okay. Mm-hmm. Logo. Okay, brilliant. Okay. Okay, so the buttons would be like, you know individual users, or Yeah. Alright, okay. Right. That's groovy. Well I like the feel of it, I like the feel of it. At Oh dear. Alright, okay. Okay, brilliant mm. Okay, nice and obvious there, if it's standing up, I guess, yeah. Oh right, okay, brilliant. Like that from its centre. Where you're, yeah, uh were you're holding it kind of Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, scale model, yeah. Mm-hmm. Alright, excellent. Okay. No. It's out of the way as well, I suppose, so. Excellent. Yep. Okay, so so Barney the banana. Ah excellent, just what we need. Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana. Cool yeah. Well, nice to have uh options at least. 'Kay and Oh there are issues, oh there are issues. Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance. Uh, let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria. Um unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons, uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros. So we have to rea Sorry, I've accidentally highlighted somehow Um. There we go. Oh god, why is it doing that? There we go. So basically, um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape, but just have it flattened. Um. Yeah, I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape, so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out. And by doing so Oh no, hold on. Doesn't save us quite as much. I don't know what's going on with this again. Oh, good point. Um. That's sort of curve in and out. No, I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half, and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward. Okay, I might be wrong though. I don't think that counts as a curve, I think that's just a shape. A curvature is like the this case. Yeah, and why why I've got it two, I don't know, I can't seem to select any more however. Right. No. It's meant to be one, yeah, I don't know why I put two in there, but um Hold on till I find it, I think this shift button might be stuck again. No maybe the shift button's stuck in. Um okay, so that would take away three, which would give us Oh that's fine. Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty. Um We cou Oh not quite, have the scroll-wheel, unfortunately. What? Yeah. Yeah, I know, that just extends it as well. I don't know. It One of the buttons is sticking, I don't know. No, it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck, or something. No that's fine. Um we've worked out what it would be anyway. Yeah. Cancel. Piss off. Oh well, never mind. Um. Right, so that's finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add? Um Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got. So Yeah. Yeah yeah. Well that's that's uh Okay, so project evaluation. We have under twelve Euros fifty. Project process, how do we think that went? Are we happy? Okay. Evaluation. Oh we've been writing this up for m months. Uh room for creativity, were we happy with that? No, I mea I think it means sort of individually. Yes, no, maybe? Okay. Groovy. So uh we're just gonna. Uh yeah, okay. Teamwork? Leadership, sorry. Thank you very much. You're all get you're all getting a raise. Uh teamwork. I thought went well. Yeah. Uh and well means, yeah. The technical stuff was brilliant. Let's buy more. Uh Right. Um I don't know what, new ideas found, means, to be honest. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Groovy. So just general thumbs up for all of us then. That kind of unfortunately is too quick. Uh. I suppose yeah. Um. That's it, um I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you. Uh Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work. Whoops. Does it go back in, does it? Reusable. I don't know what this is but it's really really annoying. Uh-huh. Um I have, yes. Huh? Oh right, okay, you've got more, okay. Sorry uh. It didn't bother to tell me that on this thing. Is it? Okay. Doesn't tell me. Oh you're doing that. We evaluated ourselves, we thought we were great. Mm. O okay, hold on. I wonder w which cell do I want. Okay, I didn't realise you had that bit. Okay. Okay. Alright, okay. The board working again, is it? Uh. Yeah. When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_, so yeah, of course we haven't actually got a working model yet. One, yeah. No it's it's like true is one end, and false is the oth Oh, I'll go for a one. Basic requirements but of the pro of the project. Yeah th Come on that was the tha 'Kay. Being fruitist. He's a tough cookie. Six. Five or six. Oh I see. Yeah, I am sort of pret uh Just the fruit does me in, I mean uh it might it might be trendy to some, but I'm just not swallowing the fruit, so um Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it. Um so yeah I'd say about four as well. Yeah, yeah. Um yeah, a three. Pretty much kept to the company strategy, so I would go for a a one, as we not only kept it, but we were limited by Cool, groovy. Cool. Brilliant. In which case we are done. 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget. Champagne lunch anyone?
