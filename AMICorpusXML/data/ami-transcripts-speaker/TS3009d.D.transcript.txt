Yeah. Okay. Mm right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. It depends on the size. If it's kinda small, this is is great. But if it's it's larger, then you want to grab it. Yeah, that's the question. Yeah, I agree with the L_C_D_ screen. You have it in your palm like this, and you can watch uh watch the screen. And if you have it li in the middle, your hand might be over it. Like you're holding your telephone. Because if you have a screen on it, you wanna look at your screen. Yeah, I agree on this. No, I don't think so. That's not uh the point And you might be uh You might be target customer. Yeah. Alright. Great. Well, this is just a short intro. I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation. That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria. So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends. And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly. Well, I put some questions in a Word file. See if I can find them. Uh uh uh uh mm. Well I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation, so uh I don't have to explain it. Uh the first question is, uh is the device good-looking? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly. Seventy five percent of them. So what do we think? Yeah No, I know, but I have to uh evaluate it. So I have to take this questionnaire. Yeah Yeah, but I can't can s Yeah, but uh, you know We dis we di we designed it to be perfect. So But we have to be critic critical about it. And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end. So we we know where we stand. 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten. Right, so Right. Uh is it good-looking? The titanium might be uh f for older people. It you put uh put a black front on it or something. Right. Right. Right, a number please. So the last one is seven. Easy to change channels? Oh, sorry. Yeah, right. Change channels? Right. The power, channel and volume buttons are easy accessible? Two? Alright. The uh device is easy to find if you lose it? Yeah. Six? Right. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Alright. Two? Yeah Yeah, I agree. No. Yeah. Right, R_ R_S_I_ sensitive? R_S_I_ sensitive? Four. Um Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's great. Well, with the uh Three. Nah f four I think. If you look at this No. Three, alright. Yeah, that's true. But Right. The average will uh come later. It has to go to twelve, right? Twelve and a half. Out. That's easy. Kick it out. Yeah. The speaker. That's some wrong info, man. No. It's uh It's just extra. Kick it out. What more? Batteries are uh quite Uh no, no no no. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen. No Yeah, but No, that's n It's not relevant. Yeah. No, Then the whole concept is uh You You can make you can make it cheaper. But if you don't sell No no no no. If if you make people brand-aware, they are willing to pay more. But Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back. If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy. If you if you make it cool to have Oh, that's just great. Oh, alright. That is pretty stupid. Y Yeah, I agree. I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen. Or you shou It's Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen. But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen. Because you have lots of functions in it too. Yeah, I agree. Osl If you don't have the money, you can't make it. So s If you don't have the money, you can't make it. So this is too expensive. So we have to make it cheaper. Right. It's just free, man. Yeah right. I want chrome. Well, th that that is the problem. Yeah. Shoot. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Right. Leadership. Well it's It was very democratic. Yeah yeah. Well Yeah, think so too. Yeah, I don't like it. Yeah? This this this isn't a SMARTboard, right? Yeah right. B but you This is just a large t large television. You u you use the Yeah, but you ca This is just a beamer function. And here, on this one, you can uh draw the pictures and things like that. But That one. That one isn't accurate. It just doesn't work. You can Yeah, but I think there's a big distinction between the these th I don't need a SMARTboard. Yeah, but give me a beamer. That's uh that's much uh much cheaper. Right. Yeah. I agree. No. Yeah. Yeah. It isn't practical. Right. Your notepad. Yeah. Yeah, it might be useful for drawings. I I agree on that. Yeah, right. That Stefan use. No, I don't think so. It's it's only useful if you have to draw something. Yeah. Yeah, great. Yeah. Wireless uh wireless things. Well these chairs, man. Really great. Communicate in between. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Well, more more information in the beginning. That's For people who uh sketch th the whole day, I can imagine that it's useful. Well Yeah, I agree. Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching. Yeah, but he's saying if it is correct, and you can draw very, yeah, very precise Yeah, mu It saves time. Celebration. Well Yeah. You better get started. Huh. Oh, alright. Oh great, man. I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom. Maybe you are broken. You know. I think she's listening. I feel watched. Yeah. Do that. Yeah.
