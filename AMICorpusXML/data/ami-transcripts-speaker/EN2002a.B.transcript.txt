Okay. So what do we need to talk about? Yeah. Uh Yeah. Good start. Oh, I don't mind as well. This wasn't a good start. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Can you use double-click or Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. And then I guess a button button makes a bit more sense, 'cause otherwise you don't really know that, oh, what if I right-click now, what happens then? It's like more if it's visual. Yeah. Do you see my Yeah. But well, we we can have both, but whatever. Yeah, um I don't I mean it w it's more like part of the browsing sort of thingy. More than the speaker characterisation, as m Steve mentioned. Um, I don't really know how to involve the speaker characterisation into the browsing. Yeah, well Yeah. I mean I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like, well if you get the speaker characterisation that someone s talks a lot in uh a certain topic, and then if you, I don't know, click on that topic, you get everything that's in that topic or whatever. And in that way but I don't know. No no no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh just let th Yep. Yeah. Like, I don't know, show the speaker characterisation for instance. Or just I don't know. But if you do double-click on something, don't you expect something to happen then? Sort of well, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh that was good start. I don't know. I guess it depends on the Yeah, what you're clicking on. Obviously. Single channel. No. No. Yeah. But uh well, couldn't we I mean you probably I don't know if you wanna have like the the full transcription and the summary at the same time. So maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary. Yeah. Yeah. Tabs are nice. I like tabs. Yeah. I don't know how easy it is. But I dunno, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or just, I don't know. Yeah, uh change the contents of the same window, like from transcription to summary. Probably yeah. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. That could probably No, no, it could be like transcription summary, like two buttons and you just press on which ever you want. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like pop-ups. I guess that yeah. Yeah. He's close. Yeah, um well could uh I don't know. Would transcripts uh b sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then. Like full meeting, meeting without disfluencies, and summarise. Yeah. Um yeah. I guess it is. I mean just to try it and I mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so eas yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just so see the integration works sort of between the different compo Um So I guess that's what we need to aim for. Yeah. Yeah. Well if I guess I mean that was probably our intention, but we might not have written it down. So I guess I know. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Say that again, O_ four. Oh yeah. Mm. Okay. I could tell you what I done in S_P_ two. Oh um I don't know. I basi I s started like browsing a bit, just like trying to see if there's anything out there to use s sort of um just yeah, searching, yeah well yeah. We're doing the. Yeah, yeah. So it just found a tutorial but i inverted search in indexing, but I haven't read it yet. But Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well I don't know if it's usable. I uh can have a look th at it. But but I found some code for like from a tutorial about i indexing. Uh whatever. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um yeah, I guess that's it. I don't know. Uh I'm I was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with the mm file messing around with files. I mean uh how much do we actually need to do. Like extracting things from the X_M_L_ files and stuff to be able to do the indexing? Okay. Okay. What are you writing in Java or yeah, okay. Yeah. you know a bunch about file things. Um yeah, I guess I mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with the file things. I mean if you already started on on doing your stuff, I guess we can Yeah. Yeah. Should we, I don't know, meet up and see what we could do? I mean, I don't know, see what you've done and see what we need when we know more of what we need maybe? Or what do we need. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Well Yep. Oh. Um Yeah, we're gonna meet up. Yeah. 'Cause it's now Okay. Okay. But it what what is it like a window where you have to wr write the search query? Or is it just what's behind it? So or how does it work then? D Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. When you like you is there a open thingy or Like well what did you two do to like how did you figure out that this uses N_X_T_ search like is it Okay. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh no. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I don't know. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. That's nice. Sorry. I'm just being yeah. Hmm. Have we these courses that we're okay. Yeah. No. I don Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. Mm. I don't know. Mine was The progress report is due on twenty third February. February. Um yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just looking at my own deadlines. See. Yeah, that would be fine.. Wasn't like what you had now, wasn't that pretty much what we agreed on? Or was it just like that one. Okay. This is illusion or whatever. Oh mm. Nice thought. I'm impressed. Maybe you should make it exist then. Yeah. Yeah. It would be nice to, I don't know, meet up and uh you can sort of show us a bit what you know already, so we don't sort of have to do all the work again of just like figuring out stuff. Just like accessing the corpus and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah. Um yeah. Yeah. Next yeah, this Monday. Just Yeah. It's full, yeah. Yeah. Well, it doesn't matter for me. I mean three three or after what? Maybe we ca In four Buccleuch. We can go look we can look at now, afterwards. Yeah. Okay. Into what? Okay uh. Yeah. Oh, is that the photo-copier I heard I heard about? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what time do we say? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Hmm. What? It's true. Yeah, I don't know. It's reading week next. It should be it shouldn't be any well, it's supposed to be next week. It's week six next week. I don't know. We have one class at least when we like speech perception, we don't have any lectures. But I think we're having like all other classes. So uh there's not point in having No, I think it w Yeah, which are a bit crap, yeah. I think the under-graduates had uh all were off totally. What? Yeah, th we will probably have it, yeah yeah. last week. Yeah. Yeah, um I guess that's it. Was there anything else? Do anyone know you wanna like take care of this or should I take care of it? Yeah. I don't know if there was something. Oh I think he basically said um the same things as in the comments, if I could read it. Can you read that? Yeah. From a single application Yeah. Well, uh that was, I guess. Oh. No. Oh yeah. Yeah? And now we have seven percent of the course already done? Is quite good. So if y If you're okay with uh having Oh. Who? Yeah.. We're done now. I uh Is she still here? Yes, you are. Yeah.
