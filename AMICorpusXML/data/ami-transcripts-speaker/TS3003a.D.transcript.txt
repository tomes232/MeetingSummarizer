Morning. Yep. My name's Frank. Thank you. Hmm, that's interesting. Sure. Yep. Visit it. Can't say I paid much attention to it, but Oh yeah. Okay. 'Kay. That was interesting. Innocent. 'Kay. I'm thinking about a swordfish.. Meat. Yeah. Hmm. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Gonna use a different line width. And I'm gonna draw in black. There. 'Kay, I'm not much of an artist, but here we go. Mm. Okay. This is my um Hmm. Sheep. With of course little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts. There. Yeah. 'Kay. They are Come on. You have to go really slow when you're writing. They're brilliant animal animals. And that's just a little me thingy. So. Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer. Interesting. A rabbit? Garfield. Yeah. Yeah. And the most interesting tail. Yeah. We're being haunted. Yeah, you got a message. So just on a side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen? Yeah. Right. No. It's off now. Well, it was on, but Ah, there we are. Well, we have a kind of broad T_V_ at home, and a D_V_D_ player, so we got like a lot of remote controls, one for the T_V_, one for the video recorder, one for the D_V_D_ player. And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all. Oh really. Yeah. Yeah. So I think you can take minutes again. Since it's your job. Yeah. Yeah. But that would be really good if we could do that. Um. Think it has to be shock proof 'cause my remote control tends to fall a lot. So Yeah, one other little thing. Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it. So you can see how much is left in the battery. But they'll also really drag up the production costs, so think we'll have to see about that too. But maybe just a little LED, I don't know. Um. Nope, don't think so. Okay. Aye sir. Half an hour. Okay.
