Yeah. Yeah. Well uh I was expecting to get, yeah, though and I did did make it in time. But it just just 'cause all the leaves and things. Um the stra the trains weren't stopping at the stations. So they decided to put speed restrictions on Yep. Yeah. 'Cause apar apar apparently p uh I'm not sure. Um the and they're bussing people into station have particular problems on it 'cause it's on a 'cause it's on a hill or something. Um so I had so I had to bus people in from like stations either side. Yes, yes. But yeah, at l at least it was speed restrictions instead of like trains flying past into barriers and things. So Oh, f yeah... Okay. Well, you know, apa pa apart from apart all apart from waiting for the get get Camtasia sorted out. Yeah, I haven't I haven't added anything to the Wiki recently. So uh 'Cause I've we've been been working on trying to get the X_M_L_ stuff working. So some the ba basically they only had to how the DOM works, um so I can do the next so I can ge generate D_D_F_ files. Huh? Um so so th yeah, so just just been reading through documentation, that's what I was doing the end of last week um just so I know how it all works and figuring out the best way to do things. Um but I'm at the moment I've I've been playing with the DOM stuff in Mozilla. Uh 'cause I 'cause uh ju just so at least I can see how it works with the H_T_M_L_ pages so I can generate um the X_ so I can generate X_H_T_M_L_ stuff and see how it all works there. Just 'cause to just see how things work in that um and It well, thing is that the A_ the A_ well the A_P_I_ is standardized by the W_ three C_. So the A_P_I_ is stan is standard between everything. Um Uh or Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is. It it just has a couple of yeah, yeah. Um well yeah but if they will b but it doe does look like it does does that this is and things like that. So I was doing the is anyway. Um it's ju it's just that that's that's quite a quick way to just to get into how how works. Because I can just quickly generate quickly generate a web page and then just add and take yeah, add things to and take things away and don't see exactly what's going on at the time. So Oh well just 'cause X_H_T_M_L_ has a nice you know, you got browsers there, so you can actually see you can actually see directly what's what's going on. Yeah, well I'll I'm using X_H_T_M_L_ uh to deter that's uh all all the web pages are X_H_T_M_L_. So it's X_M_L_ just with the H_T_M_L_ D_T_D_. Yeah. Ju ju ju just ba just 'cause we haven't uh we haven't f haven't quite finalised the um the G_D_F_ format. So just just well just Yeah, yeah. So all have to do is just change it change that sort of thing so it's uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but Um that what what what what I'm doing the moment I'm looking through the s the uh stuff that Robin put on the Wiki to say what's, you know, what what we need in the in the t um in the output format for the for the task, you know. So what what you're what you're gonna do the analysis on. Um so I'm making sure that I can take get that information out of the G_D_F_ as it st state of the moment. And if I find something that you can't get out of it then I can add that to the add that to the G_D_F_ format. So Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well the Well I'm I'm I'm ju try I'm making sure that the G_D_F_ format we've got at the moment will d will output say well I've output old analysis that that Robin's looking for. Um so so I'm using that as a way to to get into ha ha using the DOM things as well. Um so yeah. So at the moment I'm looking at act actually the G_D_F_ format itself um and then to generate the G_D_F_ format I'm gonna be taking stuff out of the gest analyser um and then using a DOM parser to generate uh X_M_L_ output from the gest analyser. Uh no. No. But uh I'll when and out of the output of the gest analyser does does do some of the processing already, which is what I'll m plan to use that as the basis for it. 'Cause that already that already picks up like target regions, things like that. So you get so so it knows whether you're looking at a part or whether you're looking at target area or what or whatever. Um so yes, as long as it got that in it somewhere. So it's just a matter of pulling that out and put that into the um into the G_D_F_ stuff. Yep. Yeah, um bu Yeah, yeah. I um I think the o the only thing I've got left to do before the experiments can be run is get s is get the check Camtasia works. Um now I've got Camtasia running on machines and I think they're set up correctly. But I can't test it until we get the microphones working. Microphones. 'Cause Ah. Well he must some these days anyway, isn't it. So so Yeah. So we all got off easy. Yeah. Ah well ca I can easy I can easy get to mapl uh to Maplin I know where it is off I used to live there. So I know I know where I used to live here. I'm a geek. I know where I know where Maplin is. Yeah. Well I suppose I could gi I could give you a call on the way in tomorrow and if th not bi it's not been in your in your f um pigeon hole, I can easy go off the train and early and just pick 'em up from there. Right, yeah. Well I'll make sure I make a I'll make sure of I got the f the phone number in my phone so I can call them. All true. True. Um uh it's Dalry road, isn't it. Um Yep. I t I'd say you don't be. Mm. Yeah, yeah. screen shots. Yeah, yeah. Oh. Hmm. Well I'm I'm using DICE machines. If he wants to pop in for five minutes, the the Windows machine is free for him at the moment. Yeah. Yeah I mean I considering we get an email from uh the I think it got sent through saying that he'd updated the the whatever it was on the Wiki. So you do he'd he'd uploaded a ne a new zip file and overwritten the old one. So Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well when the whole thing was if it was gonna run a trial that'll give you some some screen shots to work with. And then it'll just be a matter of adding new video f mouse movements or whatever. So Uh have a look. If you th anything prob any problems with it um think there's a Wiki page up for that f for that piece of uh for yeah, for that thing. So if if you just put just put whatever recommendations, bugs on that page and I'll work through them read 'em as and when I can. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Um Yeah. And like these yeah, I mean I've used the software and there's not that hard I mean. Uh Yeah. If Yeah. So well I can't imagine the building the building the mold is gonna be that hard. I mean I can easily just well however many thousands are on that uh Dutch web site you found. Just, you know, pick pick some of them, redo them in in the Ja in the J_C_D_ format. That's yeah. It's pretty mechanical. I can easily d easily do that. So but it's a matter of choosing which ones you need to do. Which I guess you have to do. Well yeah. Yeah well you need to you you and Marloes need to sort out, yeah. Um I don't think don't think so. I mean uh so the the major thing I've gotta d got to do is get this Camtasia sorted out. So just waiting for the batteries for that. Um if Robin's not worried I'm not worried. Um Um p Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'll go gotta finalise that format and then once that's done, I've gotta start looking at the analysis side of it. And that's Yeah. Um Yeah, yeah. I think yeah. No, the the analysis I think the analysis will take a little while. I don't think it's gonna take that long to get its stuff sorted out. It's gonna be how to display it and all that sort of stuff. Uh whatever makes it easiest for you to do. Um but once w Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Um yeah, so I still gotta work on the gest analyzer and turn that into the t into a G_D_F_ outputter. Um and uh oh yeah, and I'll I can have a look at the model builder as well. Um 'cause one thing I'm thinking about is w we're looking at the the part building pa type stuff. Uh and it might worth seeing if we can add a little part builder thing into the um model builder. Um just just the ju I just gotta tidy tidy up some the code for generating the parts anyway, the J_C_T_ um parts from from S_V_G_s. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But I'll wanna have a qui have a quick look and see see how easy it is to add this things to it. 'Cause um if if I can use it to generate um um the rotsym angle for example and the rotation symmetry stuff for it, which is what was causing the bugs uh before. Um so if I if I can use the model builder to automatically do that then that would sa that would save quite a bit of work and it'll d save a few bugs. So No. It's uh it's just something you gotta remember once the part's been built. So um Yeah, yeah. Well I'm not not not pl not planning do much on that. It's just Yeah. I mean I've I've already I've already got this yeah. Yeah, other I saw saw saw saw something about map task like little further down my task list. Right. Right. Yeah, well that that's that's just X_M_L_ to X_M_L_ to X_M_L_, isn't it. Turning G_D_F_ and what other bits into N_X_T_. Yeah, yeah. Right, right. Um yeah 'cause that's the yeah, o other than you have from what I've heard about it is both X_M_L_. So the the programming side of it doesn't sound too hard. It's gonna be making sure that it fits what you expect out of the format. So um but no that's that's fine, I'll d I'll have try to find I'll I'll have plen plenty of uh plenty of questions for you once I once I get to the last stage, I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we'll Yeah. Well the we're gonna get Camtasia sorted out this week and then it's concentrate on the on the gest analyzer, the G_D_F_ stuff. Um and then yeah, once once we've done that it's whatever whatever you whate whatever you whatever you want me do once I done the once I've done the G_D_F_, I guess. Yep. Yeah, so I think the G_D_F_ will keep me busy for a little while yet. So um yeah, well that's yeah, certainly keep me busy until this time next week when we can start suggesting things that might might need to look at for the next stage, I guess. Yep. Okay. Yeah. For the first, yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Actually yeah, that reminds me, I wo wo I wo I won't be uh on Thursday I'm gonna be over in my induction day. So so Fair enough, fair enough. I mean uh I don't it's meant to be that in depth. It's Yes, yes. I mean I d I don't expect to be that in depth. I mean it's fifteen minutes on a variety of different topics. So it's just it's uh it is. Uh yes it is. I'm sure most of it I already know. It's like fire safety. Yeah. Health, safety, data protection. Usual sort of stuff you get everywhere. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, I mean I can remo Yeah, I can remember when I start being a st when I was sta starting being a student. I mean ha we had the inductions were compulsory because um a lot of students were doing te were doing teaching. And you couldn't do the teaching unless you done the induction because you had to know about health and safety and fire safety before you could take a charge of yeah. 'Cause you were the responsible person in the in the class room. So So But uh yeah, I'm not sure I'm not sure why the why why I'm doing it now. But okay.. so see how it go. I'll I'll uh give you my report on Friday or something. Yeah. Huh. Okay. So so that mean you need the blink corrections part of the analysis then. Um Right. So tha tha that's uh that's for the rest of the stuff that comes the eye tracker, isn't the analyzer software that comes the eye tracker. Right. Right, okay. Well i i if if you want if you want the blinks mer merged into a fixation, it might worth making making a cr part of the requirement for the G_D_F_ stuff. So to remind me so to to just add that analysis to, yeah, to to it. So it's I mean it's easy enough to do, just che just checking the times th times of the events. Right. Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah 'cause I think the ASCII format as it stands does contain blink information um 'cause uh d d I'm sure I'm sure that's appeared in the in the documentation I've read through. Possibly. Possibly, yeah. Right. Okay, okay. Um yeah, so might might worth us us having a look at that and just just seeing what dat is what data is already in the ASCII format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis. Um 'cause I've gotta do the analysis for the fixations on parts and things anyway. So yeah, I d I I I didn't think check for blinks during that. Isn't gonna be a shouldn't be a big problem. Yeah. Yep. Um so we'll be Right, mm-hmm. And so are you looking for a final thing that just sort says between this time and this time you're looking at this object. Between this time this time you're not looking anything. And Yeah, yeah. 'Cause I think I think at the moment the G_D_F_ format has fixations in it. Um so so I gue I guess that'd be part of the G_D_F_ to transformation would be turning fixations into gazes and whatever else. Okay, okay. Well tha tha don't don't uh worry about that just the moment. But Right. Right. So so so w will you actually be doing much of the G_D_F_? Or is are you expecting do most the analysis on out of the N_X_T_ stuff then? So whe when you uh when you actually generate your results. Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah. Uh yeah. C well yeah, you told that earlier 'cause you could do a quick ana you could do a quick analysis on the G_D_F_ stuff without having to before you hit before you do the dialogue analysis type stuff. So you can get some some results anyway, can't you. Okay. Yeah. Right. Okay, okay. Right. Oh yeah yeah. The Germans don't yeah, yeah, yeah. Fair enough, fair en Yeah, so so they they we're allowed to do whatever without without source code. There's no c sort of restrictions on that. Fair enough, fair enough. Yeah, I suppose I can easy look through and start writing up some documentation on it. That'll gi that'll give us a starting point for us to sort to talk about it to look for what analysis we n actually need to do on it and things. Um yeah, easy. C yeah, create all the uh switches and whatever else you need to do. So um Okay. Okay. Yeah. So we'll on once yeah. Well once I've had once I've had a bit of bit more look at this G_D_F_ stuff, then start looking through that. Start looking through that and make sure that works. 'Cause Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I've l yeah I've no no noticed that the the the gest analyser knows quite a few things as well. So um but as Yeah. Well uh I use it that useful for generating this G_D_F_ stuff, I can easily incorporate whatever functions it takes from into gest analyser when I'm do doing the G_D_F_ stuff. So Yeah, yeah. I mean but what, yeah, say what what I'll what I'll plan to do with it then is take the is take to the software, find out what functions are useful for us in that, and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the X_M_L_ file, the the G_F_ format. Yeah, yeah. So so the fir fir first part that'll be documenting what they've got and then discussing it with Robin. So uh yeah. So so I suppose pose that that way the Right. But yeah, well I tr mo mostly, yeah. I'm sure I sure most the logic's gonna be gonna be the same. So um Right. Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, fair enough. Well so so it's so long as it's X_M_L_, N_X_T_ will handle it, won't it. 'Cause Yep. Fair enough. Okay, okay. Yeah. Well I'm well I'm well g I've got the hang of all the stuff I've been going through. And it looks like l looks like I'm coming to end of the stuff the stuff list there already. So I'm gonna have start looking at that as the next stage. So Yep.. Well, I ma I ma I may be maybe I want to check out these batteries and things, won't I? So tomorrow. Well, that'll be something to do. well well will the will the will will do if the trains are tha as bad as today. So
