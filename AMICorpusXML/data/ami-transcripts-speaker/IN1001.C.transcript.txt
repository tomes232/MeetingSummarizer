Hmm. Yes. Mm 'kay. Okay, this is. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Mm. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. 'Kay. Hmm. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I understand. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. We'll see. Okay. see the cut. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Yeah, okay. Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay. I will look to have a connection. Okay. Yeah. And we need a laptop or you have yours? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Uh okay. Yeah. Mm 'kay. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. There was some burning Okay. And the next is eleven seconds and twelve frames. Hmm. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Ah, okay. Understand. Mm 'kay. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay, mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. No. Uh I have look at the demo film, and it's about uh forty minutes and about uh hundred and seventy three different shots, so it's yeah. Yes. And uh I don't know if this is a real sample D_V_D_, because uh this will make about uh five seconds for each shot, so I think it's very short. No? I if this is to r to to to make a change in the colour, light and uh they have a lot of uh shots. Hmm. Yeah, okay. Ah, okay. Yeah, okay. Okay, understand. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Yeah, yes. Yeah. Hmm. Oh. Maybe they can Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yes. Sorry? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah, uh I think I think they made some uh special effect in this D_V_D_. Uh there is two or three time uh you see you see the same uh same kind of uh scene, uh just uh two or three seconds Yeah. Hmm. No, there's no menu. There is just one uh one chapter and no menu. Yeah, yes. Yes. Uh Uh I think in the video there's two there's two video, one is a real video and the other is a just uh introduction when you have the menu. No, it's uh thirteen minutes. No, but yes, this is the same, but uh there was a problem when do the grab from the D_V_D_ to the files. So this is why they have make two two files. But now I have one file also in the so you can process again one time. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. But the the name of the video file is video name is uh it's the same as a directory. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, yes, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Okay. Mm. Okay, okay. So every every frame on the f page is uh online. Is is a Okay. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, understand. Yes, okay. Okay. But on the on the on the server the original is a f video film. Okay. So for example you can change you can change a number to take which one, okay. Okay, understand. In the other yeah yeah. Okay, perfect. In this one, okay. Yeah, I think it's not well done, yeah. Yeah. Okay. But um. Yeah. Okay, okay, there is li local cache. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay. So if we for example now we have the c the the case that this video is not correct, because uh I have make uh event grabbing. So uh we need to remove the cache for this video or this is automatic? Yeah. Yeah, but what I mean is i i i i i if I if I put the same video with the same name instead of this one, they should uh different Ah, okay. We need to remove them. Yeah, okay. Okay, understand. Okay. Yeah, it's not a real uh usi usage. Okay. Okay. Yes, understand. Okay. Yeah. Yes, bec because this one i was uh Th this one was Yeah. Right, okay. Okay, but it's okay. It's okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. On the M_M_M_, yeah. Mm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Oh, it's Greek, but uh okay. Okay, so i if you come back now, you Yeah, yeah. Okay, but now you have s you have both cache. Yeah, okay. Yes, computer too, yes to uh but okay. But it's fast. Okay. Yeah, understand. Okay. Okay. Uh i ju just uh a question on the the organisation of the M_M_M_. So you don't have uh a part for specific uh project. Every for example if we make a lot of uh film uh for CINETIS uh all are on the top I mean uh all the film are y you you don't have a separation for the film for CINETIS or for the project and s Well you say video name equal, all are on the same level. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, okay. Ah. okay. To make Okay. If we need to make some special thing on the browser, it's t Okay. Yeah, okay, it's okay. Okay, great. Okay. Mm. Okay. Work in progress. Yeah. Input. No. Yeah uh. Mm. Yeah, mainly the t webpage or for output. Yeah. Okay. And all these uh file are only uh internal. This mean uh if I go t on uh C CINTETIS CINETIS uh From outside of IDIAP we can access this. With a password or Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yes, okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yes, yeah, okay. Okay. Hmm. Yeah, okay. Uh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I understand, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Right, okay. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Hmm. Okay, yeah. Hmm. Yes. Yeah, okay. And the code is based on open C_V_. Oh okay. Okay. Okay. Bhattacharya okay, and so on, okay. Okay. Okay, okay. So we can forget tosh and uh use uh input se the input reader for the the M_ PEG we can re lo use uh open C_V_. Okay. Okay. Hmm. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Output, hmm. Uh yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay. Ah, okay. Okay. We can skip some frames. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, it's perfect. Hmm. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, the the browser. Hmm. Hmm. Yes. Yes. Uh so just uh last question maybe, uh so this makes a X_M_L_ file. Okay. This is the the programme to to generating the X_M_L_ file and the the shot. And uh with the kayak you have one problems, you don't have the Real Media, so this is another thing. Okay. Okay. Okay. So you have some special tools from uh from Real Media. Okay. Hmm. Mm. Okay. Hmm. Hmm, okay, okay. Okay, I heard it. Okay. But uh anyway you need you need to have Windows to make these. So I will ask you or someone else, okay. Okay, okay, understand. Okay. But this is this is made by a programme done outside IDIAP. Okay. This is yes, right, okay. This not uh IDIAP programme. Okay, okay. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Mm. Um. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Mm. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Yes. I think for test I can take the real demo and make the the full processing. So I will Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Mm okay. I have some informations. Okay. And uh in this in this the begin and end the number is the for example the end is zero dot twelve twelve is uh this frame too, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What what Okay. Uh. Okay. Mm. Just what what Hmm. Yeah, okay. Okay. It's okay.
