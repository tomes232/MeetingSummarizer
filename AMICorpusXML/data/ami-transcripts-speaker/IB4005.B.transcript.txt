Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So you sa so Pierrette is a professor, but she's only she's only fifty per cent time. Is that why she's in a three person office? Uh-huh. I see. Mm. Mm-hmm. And what what's happening what what do you foresee happening in the next couple of years, like beyond this m b beyond this current group of people, do we do we know of any changes coming? Is the department growing? Or is it is it going to be Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's always the case. Yeah. And have you have you talked to th any of these people to ask them if they have any special requirements? Oh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Of people they needed to be near or people they would needed to avoid or anything like that. Okay. Okay. Alright. But you've given people chance to say that if they really needed to? Okay, good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It says mountains. Is that because that's the view. Yeah? So it's the best view. You gave the reading room the best view? Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh, two mountain views. Oh, and that's old town. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. No, okay. What's that purple thing there? Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Alright. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-uh. Mm. In the lounge, yeah. Mm-hmm. So it's not a place for discussion. And it's it's it's a quiet place. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm I see. And so i there's no are you planning some kind of partition between the lounge and the offices or ar How are you gonna keep those things I think should ask the question to you, how are you gonna keep them separate? 'Cause it seems like fairly separate functions. Book-cases or something or Yeah. Hmm. But it won't be uh an acoustic separation? So if if the Those are students there? So if they're noisy, that could disrupt the quiet of the lounge. Um, but As a separate room. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But you've also put the lounge in a a very k kind of a high-traffic area where the mailboxes are, the printer and the restrooms. So that's um That may also tha that may be good for meeting people and bumping into people, but it's maybe against the idea if it's a very supposed to be an isolated quiet spot. So I d mm, you know Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Well, maybe if it if it helps us pack more people into the offices, because they have a private lounge. maybe it's a good thing. Saves us money. But uh Uh yeah, I guess that's Let's see, what is that? Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. But you're saying it does get used. So you've it's it's not a completely experimental concept. Your your department has a lounge and it gets used a lot. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So, can you just summarize briefly the differences between your two proposals, the key differences? Uh sh shared Yeah, the shared lounge, the the assistants with their professors. In two cases. Yeah? Oh okay. So that's okay. Yeah. So Yeah. T_V_ at The lounge, the admin room separate. Not shared. Mm-hmm. Okay, so you basically achieve that by giving less space to the reading room, I think. Yeah. Right. So I guess what One of the questions is how important is the reading room to your group really? Is it is it something that's a very valued thing that has to be protected, um, or is it okay to l make it be kind of this spare space that gets used up a little bit when you need when you have some extra visitors or things like that. I think that's Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. But I suppose once it if it gets eaten away a little bit, at one some point it becomes unuseful, and then Yeah. So it Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. So what does that mean, Swedish um Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. Oh. Okay. Just S_, uh so just to know who they are, okay. I've heard of that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. So when you when you put four people in that office, does that mean you're planning on four desks? You need space for four desks? Yeah. Do you know if it's possible. Yeah. Mm right. Mm-hmm. And so you can fit that, you think. Mm-hmm. Mm. No? Mm. You mean Maybe you should break the wall between the men's room and the women's room. Sorry. No. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Is your person to square meter ratio within the n university norms? Overall. We don't we don't, I mean, we don't want people coming in seeing this lavish reading room and and and everyone having their own office if that's not what we are having in the other places. We have to make sure that um if for example there's a spare reading room, like we were saying before. Overall your department has doesn't have excessive space per person. Mm-hmm. Mm right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Mm bu Mm-hmm. Alright. Well, it's good in case I ever have to defend it. You know, it's good to have some numbers, if you can come up with some numbers uh Some And maybe uh relative to some other comparable departments. That's It's it's good to have that. But if you both agree with this plan and you think your group will be happy, then uh fine with me. I don't know about you, what do you think? Yeah? Okay. Alright. Well, thank you. No problem. Thank you. Okay.
