You can write on the paper, yeah. It's it's okay. Right. Right, right. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Okay. I have a question. Is the scale linear or is Mel scale, like in M_F_C_C_? Is it bar scale, like in like in sp yeah, okay. The overlapping is different, right? Yep. Mm. Okay and? Okay. Uh-uh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. I have never done anything. Yeah, tri-band G_S_M_, yeah. Different frequency. Yeah, exactly. Mm-hmm. Okay. True. Mm. Mm-hmm. I've never done any coding in my life. So I just have one curiosity. So this is coding then s you code the speech, then you're also supposed to transmit the speech, right? Th let's say in G_S_M_ or something else. I remember when I was doing some image processing, there were techniques for compressing and then coding. So adding channel information on the image at the same time in order to save sound bits. You see what I mean? Exactly. I d was just wondering if there's some s someone was doing it with speech as well. Well actually, when you compress yeah, all like first you compress the signal, right? And then you al you add com some complexity to the signal in order to recover the error. So I was wondering if by any chance there was something like this in speech with the speech. You don't know? Okay. Well It's not the most difficult, right? Sure, sure. And and this was the problem actually because you were No not not in G_S_M_, definitely definitely not. Uh Okay. Then th they some, you know, source. So yeah. Okay. Just one. Yeah. Definitely. Is it good? Okay. Okay, thank you.
