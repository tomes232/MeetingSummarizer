Pretty impressive. Kind of a banana. I do. Okay. You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria. Um. Okay. So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found. Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier. And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype. And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did. Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier. So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale. And one is going to mean true, that we did actually achieve that. With seven being false, we did not achieve that.. Okay. So for the first one, we need to decide, did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote? Mm. Mm. Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit. That's true. Yeah. Um okay so, do you think, since we This was a a sign criteria, do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then? Does that sound good? What do you think? Three? Four? Five? Four is fair. Okay. Okay, the second one. Did we make it simple for new users? One, 'kay. Okay. Um, do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users? I'd say that So one? Yeah? Okay. Okay um the fourth one. How about the problem of a remote being easily lost? One of the number one complaints. Whether you want to or not, you're not gonna lose it. Okay. That's true. Mm. Annoying alarm or something? Yeah. So. Are we adding one of these two features? gonna say okay. So we're back to a one? Or a two? Two, 'kay. Okay. Are we technologically innovative? From iPod yeah. But for remotes yeah. Two? Three? But how many remotes do you see like this? Not so many. Really? Okay. That's gonna hurt us. Okay. Um spongy material? 'Kay. And lastly, did we put the fashion in electronics? I'd say we did. 'Kay. Alright. Now we just gotta calculate. Six eight twelve sixteen. Seventeen divided by s Eight. Well I haven't done math in years. What two I dunno. Okay we'll say two point four two. Right? How does that look? It's been a while. Oh no. They just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically. So that's that. Oh my god. Okay. Yeah we'll go with that. Not too shabby. Right. Oh. Bright yellow. It'd look really lovely. Yeah. Leave it blank. Perfect.. What's the blue part? Oh that's the batteries. Okay. Looks more like a banana. Trying to fill in some time there. Good teamwork. Minus your PowerPoint fiasco. No I know. I'm yeah. Incom Mm. Kinda. We might have a while though.
