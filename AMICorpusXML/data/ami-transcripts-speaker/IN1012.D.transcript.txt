At this precise time, yeah. Uh you can't attend multiple session at the same time, so. Hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah in. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. But yeah. Yeah. I liked the invited speaker um about the implant in the ear. It's quite good, no? I think so, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Hmm. Hmm. No quite good uh. A bit hot still, but the bea the beach nearby is quite nice, yeah. You should try it, I don't know. Did you go around? Before or after, yeah. Okay. Yeah, 'cause I Yeah, I stayed I stayed two days before, so uh I went you ju you just take the train, maybe that's the same, I'm not sure. Train north. Half an hour train, yeah. Yeah. West or north, I don't know uh. No no no, not very far. No no. It's different, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Well y We can take the tram and a train. It's it's all conditioned. Yeah. Ah. Mm.. Ah, sorry. No no no it's uh or s I'm not sure. Yeah. Yeah, originally I brought it because I marked some papers, but yeah. Onl only o one which surprised me a bit, it was uh speaker recognition I think, but it doesn't really matter. They were trying to model uh um covariance of different components for G_M_M_, instead of using a diagonal. But then if you use a full it's too much. So they use some approach where they tie them automatically and uh after that well, it's more like tying it is still full, but different um components are tied, different components of the matrix are tied. Equal. Uh No no, you have to store a minimum number a reduced number of parameters, and they are tied in a linear way actually, sorry, not equal, but it doesn't Yeah, exactly, that's it uh. So they ju yeah. Yeah. Interesting thing is that they applied it on speaker recognition, and on the features before they had three different ways to um decorrelate the features, and and this they showed it uh without this, with diagonal G_M_M_ or with this, and with this, with uh semi-tied covariance matrices, it was a less much less sensitive to uh which um decorrelation procedure you choose. If y so. A a also better, but of course it depends on the number of of parameters you put Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I I think I think it was even slightly better, yeah. Maybe I can find it. L_D_A_, yeah, L_D_A_. Make it possible to use uh a full covariance matrix. Yeah. Yeah it's this one. It's i improved covariance modelling. Yeah. No, but in the proceedings you can find them. They are better, yeah. They tried P_C_A_, L_D_A_, M_L_L_T_. I i it's not really anything new, but uh the mm they just applied that to speaker I_D_. Yeah. Yeah. I isn't it smaller, the minimum, no? I don't know, I just Mm. Mm. Yeah, okay. But it's not uh an intrinsic limitation, it's just because of ri yeah. Okay. So it's not n it's not symmetric necessarily? 'Kay. So he's maximising that or mm Mm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, ho yeah. How did you cope with what you mentioned some time before, that if it's a very long session for each twelve point five frame you will actually get the same segment now. So how d Ah, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Sorry. Mm uh what it's a little bit what NIST is trying to do, no? So. Yeah, bu Yeah, but then we all optimise uh on the same task. So you cannot get anything new out of that after some time. Yeah, but then you run out of time. No, i ideally you're correct, uh but Mm. So yeah. Ho how how do they how do they evaluate? I just don't know. So they ask peop they ask people to sit and listen basically? Yeah? Hmm. Okay. But they d they don't have any measure like you have an original speech, you transcribe it and Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. So maybe well, but then well no, if somebody like NIST will have one recogniser and you just plug a different feature, but uh it's dangerous. Right. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hem Hemant is using difference Seems Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Would be mm would be nice for Aurora maybe to have that. Aur Aurora. Yeah. No no, but yeah, yeah. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, Daimler, yeah. I don't know. You know, they're extremely secretive. I had a hard time just to get the signals. So I asked other questions but uh it's quite tough, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they have to yeah. They have yeah, they have to do some test in their Mercedes, some speech recognition test, mm but it seems now they mm at least Daimler, they mostly work on dialogue management, uh but not much on features and recognition. No. Yeah. I d I mm. I doubt they are trying right now. I doubt that at Daimler they are trying right now, but maybe other companies, mm. Uh. Cohen? Jorda Jordan Cohen. No no. Mm. Mm. But there you could send an S_M_S_ I think, or something like that. Uh you could dictate text, so. On a phone, yeah. The phone that uh Cohen yeah, voice signals. Yeah. I don't know, that's Okay. Hmm. So it's still still real time? Hmm. Ah okay, but but not much, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Alright. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay.
