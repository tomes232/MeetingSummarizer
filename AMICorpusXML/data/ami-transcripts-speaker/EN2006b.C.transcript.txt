Hello. Right. Mm mm hmm. Yeah, it's hard to know what that is. That's this is a bit of H_T_M_L_ goo. I think there should be a break for and. And they don't know what to do with the H_T_M_L_ goo. But this this isn't a s yeah. And this isn't a separate thing, so I w I would agree that you underline the you underline the goo in each case but not the and. Right? Yeah. Okay? Mm mm-hmm. Mm. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Right, you don't get that. ESO isn't an instrument. You're right. We agreed for to keep hubble. Yep. Yeah, that should be a source type, yeah. It's Yeah, do you think that's part of the name, yeah. I don't yeah, I have no way of knowing, yeah. Yep. Yep. Right. Mm yeah. Yep, that's fine. Nope. I win. Uh Okay. Yeah, I know. Is there a prize at the end? Bottle of champagne. Um okay. Mm that's a spectral feature, that's okay. Ye Emission line A_G_N_. You can get A_G_N_ without emission lines. I think in Phil's paper he does, doesn't he? The paper I pointed you to a few weeks ago or last week. I didn't know what he meant, but yes. I've seen people talk about them as separate classes, but I don't really know what that means. Yeah. Yep. Oh. Mm 'kay. Yeah, that G_ dwarfs are things, aren't they? That's alright, yeah. I saw it yesterday. Uh yeah. There he is. By Lyman alpha forest and Lyman limit systems. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Emission models, definitely not. Um why associated? Yeah. It means it's associated with some physical thing, but it doesn't have anything to do with the spectral features, I don't think. Does it? Mm-hmm. I'm happy to say M_ two what-not absorption is a spectral feature. But associated means it's associated to some physical thing. So yeah. So that shouldn't be in. Alright. Yep. Those are mechanisms. So they don't count. Don't think. Um Yep, I just missed it. And that's it. Hmm? Yeah, we should do. Yeah, we did that the same. But it's different from what we've been doing. Yeah. Yeah, and it's not in the manual, is it? Yeah. So let's do that. Extend. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Yep. It's a kind of a regular galaxy? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Ri right. That definitely gets to go in. That's not a component. I think. Yeah, we could come to blows over soft excess. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I agree. That's fine. No. No, for continuum. Um. Yeah, that's fine. Uh I can agree with taking that out. That the so-called yeah, I don't think it should be, should it? 'Cause it's a region, yeah. Yep. Yeah, it's badly written. Infrared galaxies. We said not to mark things based solely on So it's just defined only by wave-length. So we can't include infrared galaxies. And star bursts count, surely. Mm yes, yeah, they are. Galaxies. Mm. It doesn't really matter. I'd say continuum flux but I don't Obviously. But I don't care. Yep, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm no, I'm happy to take that out. Oh. Mm no you can't point to it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Mm. Uh we're missing weak weak line.I don't oh y so they're saying weak line radio galaxies are a separate class of radio galaxy. Okay, yeah. Okay. Right. Oh. Yeah no, you've got line in there. M And should come out. Okay, mm-hmm. Yep, that's okay. Galactic black hole candidates. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think that's a source type. Mm mm-hmm. Yep. No, it's not right. Right. Uh line emitting gas I don't like, yeah. Far infrared galaxies we can't have. That's okay. Yeah, that's okay. Damped Lyman alpha absorption the same. Right, yep. Emission feature. Yeah, that can't be in. Yep. Uh yes, it should be. Yep, that should be in. That is not a source type. What were you thinking? Yeah. Dibulae absorption. No, but it says it covers a significantly small angular size. It's a physical thing. Yep. Uh this feature. Yeah, okay. Alpha. Yeah, you don't get that. Do you? Those are those are regions, globs, nebulae. Yep. Yeah. X_ ray B_L_ lax. Yep, that's okay. Intermediate types. It now if we're d Did we in the end? Yeah? Oh right. You get it then. That doesn't go in and that's okay. Right, that's okay. We don't like systems. Yeah, that's okay. Are we? Okay, yep. What line are we taking out? Line width, yeah. Line ratios. We've been taking out line as a word that relates to other words. My head is going yeah. But lines are still lines. Yeah, that's okay. Right, I agree that that can go out 'cause that's a fitting thing. Absorption features in the U_V_ spectra. Okay. It's likely one spectrum in the U_V_ which you can see absorption features in. Uh Right. Quasars quasars. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm right. And here I think I'm right again.? Line centre. Yeah, you'd you'd say line wings. Alright, you get it. Right, you win. Um eclipsing I don't think. Yeah, you're right there. Y yeah, but then the A_G_N_ like activity. So both of them have to go. A star burst is a class. An A_G_N_. But we're counting star bursts as star burst galaxies. No, but a star burst galaxy is only a galaxy which has a star burst in it. Like an A_G_ an active galaxy is just a galaxy with an A_G_N_ in it. Yeah. I think they're the same. They either have to both stay or both go, and I I think they should stay. Yeah. Star formation we weren't putting in. That Or was it's a wave-length region. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm right here. That's part of a name, yeah. Mm 'kay. Infrared galaxies. This time you have it. But galaxies should be in. Right. Uh oh, what have we done? Hubble. Yeah, ok i in the galaxy distribution. Yeah, okay. Mm. Yeah, we did it before. Yeah, that's okay. Oh. Yeah, okay. We weren't doing spectral shapes, were we? Yeah, that counts. Mm-hmm. Well Yeah, that's true. That counts. They are and it's a big joke. High balls. Uh yeah. Um next. Yeah. Yeah, that doesn't go in. That means objects that are identified and maybe at a particular red shift based on it. Yeah. That doesn't count. Mm continuum luminosities. I don't remember about luminosities. We've been putting in continuum flux. Yeah. Mm. Mine too. Oh. Radio loud quasar should be in, Z_ equals two shouldn't. The rule was to leave it in, was it? Yeah, that's for things marked with and. Yeah, it doesn't say. Z_ equals two is um means at a certain distance. Um so that shouldn't be in, but radio loud quasars is a thing. So it's whether to include the Z_ equals two in the Yeah. Oh. No. Yeah. No. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm no, we can't have that. Yep. A source type. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Um right. Yes. Um yeah. Yeah. We can rid of that, can't we? Galaxy with the galaxy. It should be the galaxy, yeah. H_V_C_ complexes. I don't know what H_V_C_ stands for, but since they're complexes we can cross it out. Huh? Do you know what H_V_C_ stands for? Yeah, that doesn't count. Mm-hmm. Scuba, that's an instrument. You're right there. Should be this and it probably is, that's probably what that means. Oh, I see. Yeah. Right. Beta line.. I don't think that matters very much. Okay. Hurray. Um oh, beta, yep. Mm no. Do we? But enhanced relative to what? Okay. But when yeah. Oh, I don't think I was doing that. Yeah, I've missed that a lot. Yeah. Okay. Oh yeah, extended emission is extended. We we've not been including extended emission. So Yeah. Weak emission levels is just a way of saying yeah, I agree. Done. Star burst contribution. Yeah, that's true. Red continuum. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that should be out. We weren't doing components. So Yeah, this is this a radio transfer thing. So they don't mean they mean photons in the lines escape. Not that that's not something you can point to. I don't think that counts. Mm. Uh-uh. Mm that should be oh wait, is that s that's an observatory, isn't it? The C_T_ is the C_T_I_O_ four metre uh the name of that telescope? No. And the A_A_T_ is an observatory as well, isn't it? So Yeah. But we if we put Yeah. But then we have to include four metre as well. No. Yeah. Right. Yep, I agree. Mm-hmm. What is that comma doing there? Yeah, no oh, I see, I see, I see, yeah. Accounting for galactic reddening contamination from blended iron. What they mean is blended iron lines. Yeah. Continuum fluxes, yeah, we're doing that, yeah. No. Uh yeah. Damped Lyman alpha Q_S_O_. Uh I don't know what that means either. One damped Lyman alpha Q_S_O_s. It's not a source type, that's definitely true. So What's D_A_? And there's W_D_s. It's twenty five of D_A_ type and six of D_B_ type. Yep. Yep. Yes, you're fine with that. Nope. Okay. Yeah. No luminos Yeah, low luminosity Q_S_O_s, no. People talk about them a lot, but Well we're doing ultra-luminous galaxies. So we should do Yeah. People discuss them as a separate class. They are as as much as ultra-luminous galaxies are. And yep, that should be in. Excellent. Regions. I shouldn't have done that. Oh, A_ and B_. No, that's the conjunctural. I'm right here, I think. If yeah. Yeah, that's okay. Uh Oh. Right. In the A_A_L_ outflow, it's a r yeah, that doesn't count. It doesn't count. And I didn't Ooh. How do you know what's going on here? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know what this means. Oh, I highlighted all as one, right. Okay, yeah. The N_ should be. Yeah, yeah. Mm. Hmm? Yeah. Oh, I see. So your N_ starts yep, yep, I see what you mean. Mm. So N_ probably should be highli Yep. Absorption components don't count. Continuum source, does that count? Shouldn't be. Mm oh so it is. That's right. Probably, yeah. Yep. Uh line broadness. That's a way of saying line width though, and we don't mark line width. Oh. Rich iron spectrum... Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yep, that's the rich iron spectrum. I agree, let's get rid of it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Right, that's not shouldn't go in. Is that everything? Yeah. Okay. Yeah yeah, we aren't gonna make it to our second cookie break. I don't mind. Are giant ellipticals separate things? I don't know. Yeah. Okay. Line emitting gas doesn't get in. If you're doing emission from high yeah. Hmm? Well she She was allowed emission from high excitation what-not. And that's exactly the same. Yeah, that's exactly the same as No. Well I'm not certain if high excitation should go in, but if high excitation should go in, I think ionized means the same thing, doesn't it? So Yeah, you're right. You've got X_ ray source R_ one seventeen. Mm-hmm. No, that's This is describing the band you do the observations in? Yeah, that counts? Alright. Right, okay. S S Yeah, okay. Yep. Yep. Ooh. Those shouldn't be there, should they? No. Oh okay, okay, okay. Ne yes. I think this is what we agreed to cross out before, isn't it? I think it's a process too, I think Especially when uh they're saying we're y we're choosing low red-shift absorption. That's not really something you can point to. Mm. I'm not too fast, I don't think. Mm no I'm not sure. It's whether it's a process or a a feature. But I can't remember what we've done before. Well if it was if it was absorption and damped Lyman alpha clouds, you'd not mark absorption. I do think it's a process, I think. Hmm? Mm? Well we've both marked it. So let's leave it there. Micro-quasars. Yeah. That means it's new-fangled. Yeah. Yeah, but they've made up that word. Yeah. But w do they what defines a micro-quasar? But. Uh yeah, you y there's not been more than one study of dwarf amorphous nuclear star burst galaxies. So that do we say we take that out? Yep, that's it in it. So that's okay, yep. Oh. Oops. Yep, that's fine. Mm-hmm. Yeah. We wouldn't have line ratios. So yeah, that goes. Yeah. No, it modifies ratios. Mm. Right. Yep, that's fine. Plus red. Yeah. We weren't doing broad-band detections. Right. That's definitely an instrument name. Right, you're right there. What does it mean? Yep, you're right. Yeah. Okay. So you can have that. Right. At the other one we stopped after four metre. So maybe we should do that there as well. Yeah. We did it this way before. Yeah, you're right. Continuum radiation. No. Neither. Narrow line region emission. Uh do you th I think that goes out. Yeah, we don't Yep. Uh yep, white dwarfs is a source type. Yeah, you're right. It is. Uh Keck is yeah. Uh we didn't allow iron spectrum. So we shouldn't allow H_ or helium two O_ spectrum either. Yeah. Iso-electronic. Yeah. Radio quasars are s type. But radio quasars means radio loud quasars. U_V_ accessors are right, isn't it? It's a spectral feature. We weren't doing flat spectrum quasars, were we? No. Were we? Right. Right. Uh you're right there. Line strengths. Means equivalent widths, yeah. Uh I did mis-group Yep. Hey. Excellent. Yeah. Hurray, we're done. Excellent. Yeah. No, you can't. Oh. Do we each remain wired up? Are we done? Excellent.
