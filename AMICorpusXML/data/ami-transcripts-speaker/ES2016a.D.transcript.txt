Uh, uh, um. Okay. I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role. In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification, and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled, and I'll be doing research to figure this out. In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web. And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did. Mm. Huh. Ours too. Mm. Ch Like a tracking device? Mm. Be good. Lot more modern. Maybe like user-friendly, like a little you know, where you can use both hands, like a little keyboard type thing. Mm. Mm. Mm. Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association, maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal. That's more on the research end, but the marketing. Yeah. And maybe as far as design goes, maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences, 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting. Futuristic. Mm-hmm. 'Kay, I'll draw something. What? My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape, you know, like video games l so. But maybe I mean that would be kinda big and bulky. We could also try to do the hinge thing, so it could like flip out that way. I don't know. That's my idea. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. True. Mm. That's fine. You're the boss, you're allowed to. Yeah. Looks cool though. Yeah. Mm. Right. Yeah. Sorry to interrupt, but we have a warning to finish. Yeah. Mm. Great.
