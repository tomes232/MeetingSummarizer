. Oh,. No. Oh. No. Yeah but young people like that. So just do normal battery. Yeah. It has to be twelve and a half. Or not? Uh, yeah. But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved, but from the side it's it's flat, and the screen screen is just Well you just have to hold it like this then. So Alright. Let's do it then. Yeah. we F_ eight. Yeah. The joystick. Integrated scroll-wheel push-button, yeah. Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button. So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it, adjust it, click again and then you're out of it. But you still But you then still need to have Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels. But you still um You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back. Yeah. Well not all. Not s not sound I guess. Mm. Yeah. Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker? Speech recognition. Right. Buttons. No, it can be disturbed by by noise and stuff like that. Let let let me see what's more what's more popular. I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition. I have to look on that. Let me see. Uh well no I was wrong. There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen. But if it But it it it's a it's a both a hypers No, but Well we Yeah we keep the screen. I mean it's it's about the same. Eight one to ninety one percent, uh sixty six to seventy six. Yeah. Let's drop the speech. Sixteen Euros. But y y Yeah. Yeah. And then and then use um The the Okay. And the menu button does also does the okay function then. And then when you in the menu S so so you activate the menu. Yeah yeah. Yeah.. Well okay. For example if you have f f four buttons, channel up and down, uh volume left right Okay, I've I think we have to keep that. And then and the power button. So that's five. That's basic. That that's what you need anyway. And then for the menu, um you can have a button that activates menu. Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button. And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel, the the the menu gets activated, and then you can scroll, choose an option, click on it, it goes into an feature. Click on it again, selects features, scroll, adjust it. Click again, it's okay. Then you only need one button to move back. Or or under each option, you set a you set an a screen thing what says back, and you select that one, click again, and you go one step back. And in that menu, scroll, click, one step back. So that then you need five buttons, and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button. But we can't drop three buttons. But I see that's Yeah. So that's not a good idea. Because which buttons do we have now? Those five which I mentioned, and then menu, and then Yeah. F of the four things? Yeah, th power. Which more? Yeah. Power. Th Yeah that's five. Yeah, okay that's seven, and one to activate the menu, yeah. So okay that's eight. Well we can't reduce that. We we keep the display. Oh, well okay. Yeah. Yeah well we need the advanced Instead of r Yeah but but that's not our market. Ah no, hard plastic. Yeah, plastic with special colour. No but I I Because we have to use the special colour anyway. You forgot that. So let's go for the plastic. And since it's not kinetic, it doesn't have to flip around that much? We still have problem of two Euros. Yeah we can't drop them. Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display? Oh. I rather keep I rather keep the display. So the only option is an hand dynamo. Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro, right. And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use. I mean it's not that important, easy to use, but Yeah. You you press it for like three seconds. Then then then you should do everything in the menu. On the screen. Yeah. Yeah, but we'd Alright. It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half. So let's see, we we drop the price by one and a half. But we still have thirteen left. Thirteen. So still half. There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing. So that's no option. We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display? Well yeah. yeah. We made it hard for ourselves with the display, but it's a cool feature. Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour? S yeah. Alright. Yeah. So I rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour. You can still play with it then I guess. I don't know. Yeah, but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working. So I guess that isn't an option. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah true. Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then. Or or do we Or do we do uncurved and flat? Instead of Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour. And a screen. Yeah. S what what is special f Oh yeah, special form. Maybe that's nicer. But we don't have any buttons. So do d Uh make it a special colour then. Yeah ma make it a special colour then. Okay. Make it a special colour and then it look fancy. So Yeah. Let's let's save it. Yeah. Let's do it like this, I mean, because it does not lose our identity of the product as we Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it. Alright. Yeah what's the next uh phase? Uh the agenda. By your humble P_M_. Oh f Frustrated. Alright. Yeah. Drop, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that that's Yeah. I uh I sure did. And it combines with product evaluation. Uh so We all have to keep in mind what has changed now. So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements. Alright. Let's make it big. Um Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale, as following. Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah. True or false, and then on a scale of seven points, a scale, as we all know it. Um Well the criteria are based on the user requirements, uh the trends from the marketing research, and the marketing strategy of the company itself. Um well they are in a Word document, which I will open now. Yeah. I don't know it's open yet. No. And we all have to uh agree on a certain level. What's this? Oh. I don't know. Um Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user. So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions. How do you think about that? Yeah the us u It it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions, in this question. So do you think Yeah. You can you can ma Yeah, you can make a lot of extended menus. That's true. I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited, to to build in menus in the screen. So on a scale from one to seven, what do you think? Huh? Two or three? Something like that? Well we have to choose one. So uh what do you say? I agree on two. Yeah. I uh I say two, personally. But Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now. Yeah? You say three, and you you said al also three? Three? Okay well I say still two, but it has to be three then. Yeah I know. So it's made bold. But it's nah, it's not very clear on the sc Maybe other colour, yeah. That's better. Uh Yeah. Alright. Oh, it doesn't have to be bold anymore. Alright. Yeah. Um well the remote control has Wha The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions. For example audio settings and screen settings. Yeah. Well, yeah. So it it's a very true point. I mean it hides all those function. But, I mean uh they're hidden in the screen. If you don't want to use them, you don't s you s just scroll over them. And you place them F I don't know where. So that's very true, I guess, for our case. Uh the second point. It shows the relevant and most used functions. Power button. Do we ha still have a power button? Well yeah the button's integrated, huh? Yeah we dropped it. You j you just push it in for Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something, and then Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Um it shows the relevant and most used functions. Yeah uh on the other uh on one side I would say yes, and the other side I would say no. So it's I don't know. Yeah. With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel. And then Hmm? Yeah. Yeah. But but how do you change from volume to channel? No. No we have n we have no buttons left. So the joystick was not an option. So so you hav So you you have to double-click, I mean, for, I mean, uh volume, and three double click for the menu, or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. But but ease of use was not very important, may I remind you. So that's Yeah but that that's not a question. Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions. Well I think it's pretty much in the middle. You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen, in the menu. So So maybe it's more like a f a five. Or Yeah. Five or six? Five? Alright. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition. Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition. But it has at least one innovation. I say two then. Yeah but that that's not that's not this question. Uh thi uh that's the other question. This one. Two yeah. I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech What? Oh not the bold one. Right. Okay, it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints, primary colours and sponge-like material. It should have been two questions. I realise now, because sponge-like material is dropped. But the look and feel Yeah. The button has also colour. Yeah. Yeah. The one. Mm mm. Yeah we have single curve now, and no and no material. So maybe in the middle or something. Yeah, I mean it's worth the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But then we would have to drop the screen. Oh red. Yeah. Yeah. I like bold. Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo. Yeah. You just have to draw it. Yeah. But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo. I mean, if there's only one thing. Yeah. So I will say that is very true. Yeah. The remote control is easy to use. Well I would say Skill, uh I would say six, or something. I don't think it's easy to use, or not so. Yeah. Yeah. It it it has a nice screen. But Yeah. Yeah. Well I I would say a five or a six. What do you say? Easy to use? Five or a six? So a six, more. Yeah, uh I would go for the six too. So Um well, another question, uh the remote control is durable. I don't know if that's the correct word. But uh In use, both battery as casing? Yeah? True, true. And the casing is plastic,? Yeah. If you don't drop it too much, it's uh should last pretty long. Yeah? But uh I think rubber compared is better. So I think a two is more appropriate than Yeah. Logo. Okay I will go go for two. Uh the last one? The remote control's a good example for company's motto, we put the fashion in electronics. uh turn around. Yeah. But um Yeah? It's not Yeah, true. So a four. It's it g it g goes, it's not the best we could do, I guess. But it all has to do with the budget, because it's it's not the bad idea we had, so Alright, yeah. Right. So if I understood it right, we have to count these numbers. Uh Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh Oh Alright. Word document, the Yeah we have to count them. Uh Yeah just add them and then uh divide them. Yeah. Mm. I all made it po I I all made it I all made it possible uh for a positive questions, so we can count it. I mean if you have reversed question, you have to reverse the scale, uh Yes. Yeah. Thanks. Oh Easy. Question number four, yeah? Yeah. How hard is it? Yeah just use Oh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads. It's a it's a bit uh Yeah. I think you can just count them by a Um let's move over. Three, plus one, four. Nine. Uh, yeah. Are you here? Eleven. Fifteen. Sixteen, yeah. No sixteen. Uh sixteen plus six. Twenty two. Twenty two, yeah? Tw Twenty Twenty eight. Twen Uh okay. By nine. That's uh three uh Or le less than a three. Yeah. Twenty eight di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one. Yeah. Yeah, but there are no negative questions I guess. Good example. Durable use. Easy to use. This is good. Fancy look and feel, that's good. Technology innovation was good, because of a marketing uh requirement. Re relevant most used function. And hides these functions. That was also a good thing. And then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing. So it were all positive questions, by uh by purpose. So Yes, so the It tells us something, yes. Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things, I guess. Yeah. Nah it it's it's better than average, but Yeah. So th Yeah. No. The colour and the screen. Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this With some casing around it, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Do we have to do other things? Or just redesign? Alright. Yeah. So you made a start, right? Yeah. Alright. The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables, like primary colours, spongy shape. The playfulness, we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour Okay. That's conceptual, yes. Mm. How many pages? Alright. Y you have you have done the first two. Okay, and and the look and feel is Yeah. The items we had to drop. Where did we start with price? Twenty six and a half. Or not? Or twenty six? Something like that. This? Speckles? Uh Yeah. Yeah. Some some big dots. Yeah. .... We have the original balance sheet, or Yeah. Woah. Just cut. Control Z_. Yeah. Yeah. Just dual screen. Very nice. Yeah. Y y you you you push the button or something. Or Lot of options. Yeah, the R_ and another R_. It's called the Real Remote, right? Maybe maybe it c it can say that. The Real Remote. Yeah. Welcome. Yeah. Yeah. You can copy and paste the picture if you want. Yeah. What is that? Look more Looks more like a campfire. Yeah. Yeah. Type in your report. I don't see any new messages. So Hmm? Luckily, yeah. What time do we have to deliver the report? Four o'clock or Or before that? Just compare uh No it's on the on the beamer I guess. Yeah. Strange. This something what's projection from behind, I guess. Yeah it it's a beamer, but then with a within a mirror, yeah. So it looks like a big screen, but in fact it isn't. Well it's it's single single curved. Th this is flat. Yeah. But it's it's better to have in the front, this kind of shape, because it looks nice. I mean you see more of this than of that. Yeah, more like that. It's not very uh ideal. Do like this. Yeah. What's this? Ooh. But I don't see a detector over there. I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on, and then draw right lines or something. Yeah. Or just messed it up. Yeah. Yeah but it wasn't good. Yeah it it has to touch the corners, I guess. But th this one wasn't good, because if I was drawing here, I drew a line and then it came over here. Oh. Ooh. Yeah yeah, it's it's okay. It's working again. It's better than before. Yeah. Yeah that's improved uh pretty much. Yeah. Yeah but it's better, it's better Mm. No. It's better than it was I guess. Silly. Yeah. Works pretty well. Five minutes before the meeting's over. And then? We have to present Alright. So it after the after after these five minutes, you have to Alright. After after that five minutes, you have ten minutes to finish it, or Alright. And we uh Right. Chill. Huh. Uh Yeah? Next slide. Yeah? How do you do it? Alright. Yeah. Yeah. And we move more to to working together as team, because at first you you make your individual contribution, and then come here, and you have no idea what the others have to make. And then finally you have some idea, okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that, and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own. So The process, I mean, the interaction between us became better and better I guess. Yeah, especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Li Limiteded afterwards, but If if you don't take that into account, there's plenty of room for creativ creativity. Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means of uh the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that. Mm uh I think in in essence the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard. Because it it it just works better. I mean uh uh I've made yeah, uh I've made several notes just to test it, and and just put the pen in into it, and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly. So it it's better a better device than uh than the screen. But the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. Yeah. Yep. Warning. Finish meeting now. Well, it It's use especially useful, I guess, to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff. And and the screen and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience, and then to Yeah. These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things. So Yes. Check your email. You also. Right. Yes boss. Well see you soon. Yeah.
