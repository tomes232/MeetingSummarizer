Is everyone ready to start? Okay. Great. Well, welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design. I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running. Okay. Um, on the agenda for this, um, for this particular meeting, we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting, after we came up with um some general ideas of our design. And, um, then we have to make some key decisions on, on our remote control concept, and how we're gonna make it, what uh materials we're gonna use, and that sort of thing. The meeting will be forty minutes long. And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter. Alright, and I will switch up PowerPoint. Okay. Um Are they all included, like mandatorily, or r are these different options? Yeah. Mm. Um What is a hand-powered dynamo? Just every, every once in a while? Just every once in a while or constantly? Alright. It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think. No. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Um one thing with the scroll buttons though. It, it we would have to have an L_C_D_ um display, and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Um, one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as like as the exterior. This is the one thing that's protecting its innards. Yeah. Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates. Um, is it I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there. Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate. It would work that way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. So maybe the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds good. I, um, is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber? Okay, we'll just say yeah. Yes, just why not. Alright. I like the kinetic energy source idea. Um, I don't know when people will, um, be moving a remote around a lot. But I think that it's worth it, kinetety, kinetic um energy source. It could make an we could have any kind of style. It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky, and Yeah. Just for environmental reasons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then. Yeah. I think that might be a little impractical though. Yeah. Like people don't wanna have to worry about that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it. Yeah. Alright. Cool. 'S that the end of your presentation. Alright. Thank you. Yeah. That's um Oh. Okay. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause I'm sorry? Um, because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard, so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard. You're pressing the numbers for, um, for what you want. Yeah, we'll be doing Yeah. It'd be more a command interface, and then Yeah. Hmm? Yeah. I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things. Yeah. Yeah. What do you mean? Oh yeah, like how the buttons Yeah, as a button though. So, it's a keyboard in the shape of it, right? Okay. Yeah. I like that idea. Yeah. I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget. A bit more too, yeah. Mm-hmm. Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour, just to keep it, give it a simplistic look. Yeah. Yeah. But what about the lighting up effect? Um, well, um, I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up. And so if they were black, it wouldn't be possible for them to light up. If they were white they would glow, probably. If they were made out of rubber. Oh. Where would the light come from? Yeah. Yeah, and well rubber is a more translucent product too, so we have that taken care of. Oh. Mm. Well, if they're raised up buttons. So that you can feel them. We were talking about it being more um, a lot more tangible. Um, it might be more difficult to do. If they're, if they're sticking up. If it's flat then, like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone, it's like all very flat, and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons, but Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Alright. If it's do-able we can do. Yeah, sounds good to me. Alright, thank you. That means you're up. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring. Everything else we can really, we can really um, do, according to our plans already, given the market. But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control. Yeah. Yeah. But they still need to um fit into people's decor though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tone it down. Yeah, like more like photos of fruit, on, on our product. Mm-hmm. Yeah um Alright, given that information, we need to start making some more specific decisions. So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again. But it's still around right? Okay. Okay. I'm just trying to make this pop up now. Alright. Here we go. Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do. So energy, we oh. Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting. Does anyone know how to take it out of Um, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um, so back to decisions. Energy, we've decided on kinetic, right? Okay, so that's good. Hmm. But would a backup really be necessary? I mean will people just use the battery if there's no, if there's, if there is backup. Yeah. Yeah. There's like no reason why it wouldn't work, right? Yeah. It could even be one of our selling points. Yeah. Yeah. Environmentally conscious or something. Yeah. Alright, the next um decision is chip on print. I don't exactly know what that means. Right, and we were going for more simplistic style, right? Yeah. I think we decided on the pushbuttons, right? Yeah. Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting, the interior lighting system? Yeah? Okay. That's called medium, or regular? 'Kay. Okay, and cases. Um, does this, is this dependent on shape, or what it's made of, or what? Yeah. Well, I guess plastic and coated in rubber. Plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable um yeah, interchangeable plates. Okay. User interface concept. This is your time to shine. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Command interface. Did you say command line? Okay. Line interface. Alright, and supplements. What's that all about? Um Mm-hmm. Um, what are our choices here? You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels, and we'll have the channel-changer, and volume, and power? Um Yeah. Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels, things like that, because different televisions will have Um, yeah. Yep. Yeah, it was hardly ever used really. Yeah. And most televisions will come with a remote. Yeah. 'Kay, well we know we want numbers. Yeah, it does. Yeah, and different televisions. Like we, I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that. Volume. Yeah. Oh. We have five minutes to finish our meeting. Crap. Okay, um, let's do this fast. Um Should we have audio? It only comes up on mine usually. Yeah, I don't, I it's, it's a problem with the international uh appeal, I think. Um, if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work. But we know that everyone has this and it's the same. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Good. And, okay, in closing, 'cause we only have five minutes. We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes. Um, you'll be working, Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design. Wait a minute. Is that right? Yep, and um the user interface design, so this is where the trendy stuff comes in. And you'll be evaluating the product. Um, Poppy and Tara will have to work together, using modelling clay. And, um, your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen. Alright. So, anyone else have something to say? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. five.. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Lots of yeah. Alright. 'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then. Alright. And, um, we'll reconvene in thirty minutes. 'Kay. Bye. I'll see you later. Oh, what did I just do. Okay.
