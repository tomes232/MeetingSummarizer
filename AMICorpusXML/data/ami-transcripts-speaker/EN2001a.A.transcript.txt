Okay. Does anyone want to see uh Steve's feedback from the specification? Right. Not really, um just what he's talking about, like duplication of effort and Like duplication of effort and stuff, and um yeah, he was saying that we should maybe uh think about having a prototype for week six, which is next week. Yeah. So we should probably prioritize our packages. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Has has anyone actually looked at the Java code for the, huh? Hmm. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I I don't know about the search functionality, that might be online. Depends how it's gonna work. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that makes sense. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, you just concatenate them together. Hmm. Yeah. It just means it loads on demand. It only loads when it needs a particular type of file. Like when it's being accessed. Yeah, I think that's the idea, it just loads the particular ones it needs. But if you were doing a search over the whole corpus you'd have to load them all. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Yeah, we do not want it in to develop a little tree display as well for multiple results. Yeah, but that'd be quite easy to do. You just need to find the time stamp. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think I think those segments for each utterance are split up. Think so. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's already there. Pretty sure that's already there. The the utterances are numbered. Hmm. Yeah, I think so. Ye that's the impression I get, yeah. Oh. Hmm. Ye Mm. Yeah, uh Right. Okay. Topics, yeah. Yeah, I think that's the right one. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Hmm. Yeah, that'd be much more efficient to do that. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, you're able to do that in Java, yeah? Yeah. Huh. Hmm. Yeah, I've had a b I've had a look at the the topic segments, how it's stored. And then yeah, th those are few per meeting, and it um well, it gives a time stamp and inside each one there's uh the actual like utterance segments. And the list of them that occurred. And they're all numbered. Um so that's where that's stored. Yeah, so I guess um if I'm gonna be segmenting it with a L_C_ seg then that's like same format I'd want to um put it back out in so it'd be equivalent. Well, like the integration. What do you mean, integration? Hmm. I don't know. I don't think anyone's been allocated to do that yet. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, definitely. Hmm, yeah. Yeah, it c could be difficult, yeah. Yeah. Well I guess the important thing is to get the crucial m modules built. Ye yeah. Yeah, and then Yeah, and then we'll maybe have to prioritize somebody into just integrating it. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so. Uh yeah. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Jasmine, I thought you just said that you'd uh looked at extracting the text. Yeah. So you you said you did it in Python, yeah? Yeah, did you use uh b the X_L_ uh X_M_L_ parser in Python? Right. Yeah, sounds pretty good. So um 'cause, yeah, I was having a look in it a look at it as well and I noticed the um the speakers are all in that separate file? So did did you have to combine them all and and then re-order them? Yeah. Ye yeah, c Right. Yeah, so that's approach um well, I was going to do. So yeah, we may as well collaborate. In the word files? I'm not sure I what you mean. Oh right. Hmm. Hmm. Mm I thought they were local to th a particular meeting. Hmm. Mm is there anything else we should discuss? Yeah, should we not have like a group directory or something where we can put all our code in and that kinda thing? Hmm. I've gotten mm hardly any Hmm. Yeah, we can ask Steve if um we can get space. Yeah, uh we could do that. Yeah, I'm sure he had to deal with that last year. Yeah. Hmm. That sounds good. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna need. Yes. Yeah, it's just mo changing it a bit. Yeah. No, but uh that's what M_L_C_ seg does. It it marks the end of each segment. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, for me it's better if they're by meeting. Then that'll be really easy to do once they've got the raw text. It's just a case of running the script. Yeah, I mean hopefully this week. Alright. And we could Don't know. Suppose we're just getting on with all our components. So I know. Wa Yeah. Yeah, he suggested that we could have an uh initial prototype. I know, I'd b I'd be surprised if we can get anything working by next week. Alright.
