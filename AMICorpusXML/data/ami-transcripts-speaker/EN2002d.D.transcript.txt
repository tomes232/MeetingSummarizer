wanna go today. Ooh. Yeah, seems slippery. What day is it? Okay. Summary. Um no. No, just the summary. No, that was just summary. No. Um no um okay. Oh, write the sum okay, right. Yeah, okay. I did I was trying to I didn't have privileges to get in to update your file. I w I actually meant to I meant to send the email and then I was just c didn't get around to it. Yeah, I had yeah, 'cause I forget mine as well, and it's just like, you know, every time put something in there. Um so yeah, I was j yeah. That was the main thing, so um as soon as that's in it'll be right out. I was making a couple of little change as well. So so those will be able to play with. Still working on the um trying to get the topics and summary search implemented as well. So that's that's sorta tonight as well. So Um yeah. Other than that it's sorta coming along. Um getting a better feel for all these NITE objects. It's just I don't know, it seems a little chaos. I don't know, it's just it's um I don't know, it's it's like if you're gonna use this stuff later on in your life, then you t spend the time to invest and learn all about them, but it's like okay, wow. What's the minimum I can get away with that that will get me what we need. So it's like, I don't know, unless I wanna do something with this in the future Yeah, right. Yeah, mm. I don't know. Anyways, so um yeah, that's my bad. I th I think I yeah. I I saw that and I'm just trying to remember if I did create it, 'cause I think I was 'cause I was trying some stuff uh a couple weeks ago, uh so that may be mine. Um Oh really? Okay. Oh yeah? Okay okay. Yeah, 'cause I saw it again today and I was just won Was that me. Yeah, I think that was me, I think so. Um but yeah, I'll yeah that was that was and sure. No. G Give you false impressions of what's hap s something's going on. Yeah, I know it. Tons, tons. All those objects, yeah. Right. How's our quota on that? What's what do actually do you know how much we have? Yeah, okay. So we probably won't have to worry about that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, exac exactly. Um I don't know. How's everything else going? Oh, yeah. Actually Do we wanna keep that? Like are we keeping that how that happens? It just prints everything out in the in the shell as well, like as it does everything, it just kinda I guess that's its default behaviour anyway. So it's just kinda doesn't really do anything. So, okay. Oh, right. Yeah. 'Kay. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I was more or less just playing with the things that had to do directly with what I was doing, so I didn't didn't take it for a full test drive yet. But uh I can do that. That's well, right after this, yeah. A lot of this Java stuff isn't though. Mm-hmm. If you if you ch if you change your window manager, it might look a little bit nicer. Just yeah. Oh yeah? Okay, right. Yeah. Yeah. Actually can we run it on Windows. Oh yeah? Okay. Were you using like a GUI builder or just all from code? Okay, and that's That's nasty. Oh yeah? Wow. Okay. Hmm. Well well can you can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there? Just yeah. I don't know. I've done stuff like that before, it's insane, it's insane. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Right. What was it? Well, it's kinda boring, yeah. Exactly. Hmm. Right. Oh yeah, cool. Okay, right. Or I don't know, if we have like uh a choice, so they can filter those out f the the top most common, just say okay all show all or show, you know, only the im interesting ones. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, yeah, it doesn't really matter. Well, if we just automatically filter these out. They're boring.. Mm. Right. Yeah. Okay. Actually yeah. This is good for browsing though. It's perfect. I mean that's sorta exactly what you wanna do and look at these things. And so Yeah, who's doing what. Exactly. It's fun. Right. Yeah. Let's take 'em to the next joke. Yeah. Hmm. Right, okay. Yeah. Well it's not a real joke anyways.. Yeah. Okay, that sounds real so that's sort of implemented now or is that or is it close? Wow. Super. Okay. Like to test that. Mm. Actually Yeah. And when I update my N_L_, just uh recompile the M_ browsers and then just uh get that. Yeah. Well, so it'll use as my part as well, my um the M_ search. It w actually do we have like naming convention for s our sorts files? Just prefix 'em with an M_ and Or Yeah. Yeah. Well that's sorta what I was doing. It Like for your stuff do you have no. Oh okay, alright. It doesn't really ma no, it doesn't matter at this point. No, I was just kinda curious. I'm thinking about future stuff maybe, if Yeah, that's true too. Yeah, yeah, doesn't matter. Yeah, exactly. 'Cause Yeah. Okay. Oh yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Mm yeah right. Yeah, I know, yeah. Same here. Oh right. Super-size meeting browser.. Well, it's. I don't know. Um Just probably basic just text font, and just something nice, something solid maybe. Be a good Yeah, exactly. I know. Anybody have any um artistic talent? No? No? Ok Yeah. Oh it's possib some people are balanced. Some people are No, I know some balanced people. no. Maybe I'll check see if I can find anyone. Um Okay. How do you s add that to the to the Java programme? Is it just basic little Okay. Uh-huh, yeah. Oh. So just in the main frame. Okay. Okay, right. Right, okay. Oh, so it'll do the automatic scrunching down if it's bigger? Oh cool. Nice. Super. They know it's a distincting di distinctive experience, I guess. Yeah. Can we g Can we get sound on these machines? Yeah. I wish Actually have you ever managed N oh yeah, you must have, yeah, got play any sort of music on the DICE machines? Right, okay. Oh right right. They have them on the front too, I think. Yeah. Mm. Okay, right. Right. Damn. Yes. Yeah. Get a lot of audio. No. Okay. Um okay, well this this looks good.. Yeah. Are we gonna be uh trying to get the output from that and I don't know, still haven't found out if it's um feasible to open up more than one well, as many mm NOM objects as we can for each meeting to do like we were gonna need like figure that the ranking did make sense, like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first. So if we are gonna look through only five of them, just pick the top five to to do the the search and Since that's probably what we're looking for anyways. So Yeah. Are you serious? Maybe I'll try. Yeah? Okay. S Yeah, I'd That'd be a surprise 'cause I'm bad at Java. Yes. Um Yeah, seriously. Mm yeah. Practical Java. Yeah. How do you guys find the documentation for N_X_T_ and Yeah, okay, good. That's my belief as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Well it's still I guess research platform. Uh Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Okay. I was just curious. Well So c did we have a date for when we actually want the system done? I thought I thought we said th I thought we ch yeah, I thought we change it to the tenth or something. Um 'cause the thing is I mean we can keep working on little things f you know and sh Oh, well we should do this or do this. Should we Um so I don't know, do we want to set an actual hard deadline for like did when exactly were we gonna start the evaluation? Mm 'kay. Well we yeah, I guess well we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for for the people and just yeah, come up with scenarios, that sort of thing. I mean that's that's fairly straight-forward. And could actually be fun. Yeah, exactly. That's true, just brain-storm, yeah. Yeah.. Yeah, that's true, yeah. Yeah. Right. To work on it as well. Yeah.. No, I've I've got my D_N_L_G_ presentation on Monday. I have to read the paper. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so. We'll probably have to talk to Steve at some point as well I guess. But um I'll probably just have a regular Tuesday meeting with him. Like we can send him an email, but I don't know if he's around even. He's not around this week, is he or that's why I think that's why we didn't have the the meeting. Yeah, 'kay. Yeah, it's true. Although do we really want the answer. S s So if we don't ask we can push it off and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's You're right, yeah. We're looking for volunteers. Yeah. Yeah, if they have time. It's hard finding people. Yeah yeah I know, but Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually some other friends of mine in different programmes might might be more willing. Have more of a break. So that might be an idea, get a range of types of people as well. Like not like highly computer lit like not, you know, Linux literate or yeah. I think that might be good, as well. Set a wider range of people. Uh no, I think like three or four maybe. Bet that would be a good yeah, I think that d No, that's that's a lot. No. Yeah, exactly. Like the thing like did an H_C_I_ course a while ago and it's just that's what these yeah, there's three people. Yeah. And that was fine. Then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. S We don't want to. Yeah, exact exact Mm visible minorities. yeah. Three or four. Oh God. Um but yeah, if he finds them, then that's cool. If he finds the people. M um Oh, writing up. Looks brilliant. Okay. Um I thought the evaluation maybe for the report. So th and that's due on the twenty fifth. Twenty fifth is is it? I is it? That's what I understood. I thought it said twen I thought he said twenty fifth. Even though it's Good Friday, I thought okay. Yeah. Oh yeah. Easter two days yeah. No. Well it wasn't originally either. So Um Yeah, okay. Okay. So that gives us two days to do the uh evaluation. No evaluation I was gonna say. And report. I didn't think so necessarily. I wouldn't I wouldn't assume. But we should ask him. Yeah, that's probably c Like, it's a good target. It's a good Yeah. Mm, right. Yeah. Actually it's fun No. No, it's it just funny that, you know, have it finish by Monday. 'Cause after Monday I'm pretty much free for about a week or so. It's like it's like if we had, you know, a bit more time. Yeah. Okay. Oh the next one, okay. See, I'm yeah I'm free this after this Monday, and it's well, why? What else uh that's that's easy compared to the other stuff. I mean I'm not even worried about that. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Oh. You didn't know that? Oh yeah. How's yours? Thank God. Okay. Maybe that was us then, not him. No actually I might have this stuff here. Schedule. Yeah, Thursday twenty fourth. Deadline for submission of final report. Oh. Well now you can. Yeah. So twenty fourth so it we sh Yep. Um just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration? Or We should have it done anyways. But okay, yeah. Sure. Hopefully, but yeah. Is is that is that a part of the demonstration, did they want that information, the evaluation as part of yep. Right. Oh right. Um there are a f a few little things. Um just made some comments the last meeting. Just general, like how it all integrates, blah blah blah, all this kind of stuff. But yeah. No. I'd expect somewhere ten to fifteen pages. Although it's fifty percent of the mark I think, is it? I think. yeah. Exactly. Well we have a bit of time to do the writing up. So that'll be good. Yeah. Just a fine-tuned or detailed and yeah. More stuff. Yeah, that could be yeah, that could easily be five or six pages. Okay. Sure. Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, no no big rush. Although just to get it out of the way. So I'll try and remember to do that to my own s Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Just basic um pretty much like the interim do you wanna do you have the interim stuff? Just um sorta like Google type thing and just um Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Then as these come up it'll just pop 'em in there. It doesn't do anything yet. S like that's that's the other big part. I mean how to get that that communication between the two different kinds of windows. Because the thing is if we have different things in here, like transcripts versus summaries versus topics, um that was why it was sorta deciding to get the three panes in there instead of just the one. Um Yeah, so so there's a couple of those little things as we Yeah, exact It's beautiful. Yeah, m M_ makes more sense. Okay. Is that how it works in the other ones? In like the other windows like the various like um if we're in the topic. Or If you have like a particular w window that you want me to mimic its behaviour, then like just find it in the programme and just say, okay, just how this one does it. So if it's like the topic window or the whatever. So then I can just sorta trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring 'em into here. So Hmm. Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. So one left click just highlights Is that? Oh just the item in The transcript or whatever it is. The If even if we could just Yeah. That should be possible. Right. Oh yeah. Although, yeah, this this will uh this is actually different from how we print it up here. Like if we're doing a global search, then we are gonna do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms. And then we'll either, you know, multi-select or, you know, choose the one we wanna actually do this wi I think multi-select would make the most sense. Well just um if there's like three of the top meetings, like like we said before, language, we're looking for the l word language and get the highest-rated ones. To actually look for the terms we're not loading it on a val of seventy six I mean or seventy five, whatever it is. Um so the r the results from that will, you know, narrow down what we're gonna use for the local search. Then we'll just do the local search on those ones that are chosen. And if we can yeah. So it it will be a bit different from from how that is right now when when we do the global search at least. Yep. Yes, yes. Exactly, yep. Okay. Hmm. Um so that we search two different Right. Yeah. That's actually fairly You know, local anyways, yeah. No, that's easy. Sure, yep. That's that's quite t straight-forward. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Well it it kinda makes sense. It would be kinda cool Actually, are we bothering with our topic stuff still? Or is that sorta gone like our own topic segment. Like since we can't do the labelling and all the rest. We are still doing our topic segment? Well you are you are, I guess. Okay. But we're not gonna be we won't be l doing a global search on the topics for our topics, since they don't have labels. Probably? Okay. La label all the label ones I'll open 'em. Yeah, all the label twos, yeah. I don't know. Okay. Mm. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Well no, it will be kind of straight-forward. Like if you're creating if you're creating X_M_L_ files of this Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Yep. Right. Mm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Probably not. I mean just get work done. I think that's what I've gotta do. Yeah.
