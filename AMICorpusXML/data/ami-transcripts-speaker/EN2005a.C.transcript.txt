Yeah, mm-hmm. Hmm. Thank you. No, I don't think so. I d Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Meeting action. Mm. They just mention that they want decision um for issues, action items.

Mm-hmm. Contact. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um right now d uh I'm doing I'm trying to do the uh meeting action segmentation. J because uh after talking to Jane um just uh we have different ideas whether uh meeting action will be about the same size as topic segments. So um it would be good to um t right now I'm doing this, um looking at the data and trying to see if I can do the meeting action segmentation first and the scheme, and then do topic segmentation again to see if the boundary actually coincide with each other. Yeah, if if that that do, then maybe we can talk again whether um i it it make sense. Mm-hmm. Alright, yeah. Um I have just started. And um so far um I s think uh it's uh it I think it it's a still um about the s about the same level of segmentation we're talking here. But uh maybe the boundary will not be exactly the same. But uh that that the segment Mm-hmm, right, sure. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm, sure. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. I want to see. Something. Sure. Mm-hmm.
