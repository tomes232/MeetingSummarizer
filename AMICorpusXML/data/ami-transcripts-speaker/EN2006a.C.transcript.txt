Right. We did, yeah. Yeah, we did two of those, didn't we? I think we did two training sets and then we had at least one meeting with you where we talked it all through. Yes. Yeah. I'd say no, but I d I mean I thought we had basically the same ideas to b I don't remember ever having strong arguments about what should be in what group or it was just the rules about things that s yeah. And what counted as wha as for the spectral features it was more confusing what counted as a spectral feature, and we had a long discussion about that. But I don't remember sort of arguing from different sides and converging, just sort of piecing out what would come up and agreeing what we'd do. It probably would be, but I don't i it's been a long time, yeah, since we've done this. Yeah, that would be handy. Sign off. We did send it to him, yeah. Yeah. There's a cool little count-down clock that lets you know exactly how long you've been meeting as well. No, we don't at all. Yeah. But they're hardly in our areas. Uh Yeah, I did as well. No. It's a very strange interview feeling as well, because you can't see them while you're giving your talk, because they just show usually they have a camera on you and a camera on them, but during the talk part they have a camera on I believe them, 'cause I could see that guy reading a newspaper halfway through my talk. And then they had a camera on showing what my slides were, and so you forget that they can see you at all, and so when all that was over, they were answering me questions and the view switched again, I realised they were sitting there in the interview going. So Yeah. And you can't say looking over here. Like o. Yeah. Yeah. It is really strange. Mm. Excellent. Right. Shall w shall we dive in in the interim? Or Mm. No, you wouldn't do. I think I'm do I think I'm working out who's top and bottom. Um Yeah, I'm happy enough with that. I don't feel strongly about it. Ah. Ben said he he left it out on purpose, which is reason Yeah. I'm pretty sure I'm top. Uh Right. Right. Yeah, I think that's probably right as well. Okay, next. Okay. So here we're missing soft component on the bottom. There. If you get line I get soft component. Yeah. You can point to a soft component. Yeah. It's a big bump in the soft bit. It c uh yeah, I'm not fussed about that. They both mean the same thing. Yeah. This is the this is the thing you point to, yep. Yeah, that's the thing you point to and this is a ph a physical mechanism. So yeah, I'd say Two down. Two hundred and fifteen to go. Excellent. Mm that's definitely two. You're right. I think that's true. Alrighty. What are we missing? Broad line. Yeah, that's true. You get that. Uh I don't remember what we were doing with nebulae. We weren't doing like H_ two regions and stuff, were we? I can't remember actually. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Mm we were doing descriptions that made things separate classes, in which case I'd argue for elliptical I think. My God, I've just gone mad with the underlining here. Yeah, I. Yeah, that's the thing, but you wouldn't know it was a p yeah. The parallel index is something you desi derive. A break in a spectrum is something you can point at. So Yeah, b that thing there. And if I did it again, I'd say a slight depression of the continuum and possibly well, 'cause you can see both the slight depression and the Lyman limit. But we're supposed to say the descriptive words of the features. So Mm-hmm. Yeah, but they would be the same they'd both be the same spectral feature, whereas here they're two spectral features. There's a Lyman limit, which you could see, and then there's a slight depression near it. But Yeah. Do you have a sense about that? Yeah. Excellent. Yeah, okay. Uh-huh. That I didn't mark because it's the physical process of absorption. Not the the thing. Yeah, if it was there's an absorption feature or absorption to see it the spectrum at this wave-length. But when you say for example the the quasar is absorbed, that just means the quasar is behind a a bunch of stuff. So that's describing something physically rather than describing the spectrum itself. So Thank you. I don't remember what we were gonna do about things that weren't there. It's not something you can point to. You could point to it if it were there. Marked it, yeah. Yeah. Huh? Oh yeah. Yeah. What were we saying about nebula? Source types. No, nebula counts, doesn't it? Right. Yeah. Yeah, but that's line ratios. But Uh, line in in line in line ratios is modifying ratios. It isn't it? It's it's not talking about specific lines. A line ratio is a thing. Right.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean you wouldn't you wouldn't include abundances or line strengths. Yeah, it shouldn't be in. I don't think. Whoop, no. Oh, I see what you're doing, you're circling the one we like, right. Oh sorry, um yep. Uh right, damped Lyman see again, that's uh these are source types, the um I mean it's not a source type. B But damped Lyman alpha absorbers are th are physical things, not spectral features. Ye But uh you wouldn't be able to point something in a spectrum and say that's a damped Lyman alpha absorber, unless you'd Yeah, you could do. But we wouldn't say absorbers were a type of source. Okay. I'm not certain about that, but I Hmm. But D don't with damped Lyman alpha observers you them a variety of places along the line of sight? So you have to know If you look at a quasar and you see a bunch uh if you got a bunch of clouds of gas in the way, you can see these things and but you wouldn't be able to point at one of them and say ah, that's a damp yeah. They're gonna be at different red-shifts. I don't know how they do th that. But Yeah. Ye Well no, but you see them in all sorts of different red red-shifts. It's like the the Lyman alpha forest, sort of. And I'm not certain I would I would mark that. It's a tricky one. Um no, I wouldn't, because it's they're physical things, not spectral features. You can't point at something on a spectrum and say that's definitely a d damped Lyman alpha some I g and I guess it's because they're modifiers of this source type, and we wouldn't mark that source type. We wouldn't mark absorbers, no. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm it's tricky one. Okay. Okay. But we weren't going to include s descriptions of spectral features that were based on fitting, were we? Have we? Steep soft component. Yeah, breaking the power law is something I'm not certain of. Steep soft component is something you can point at in a spectrum and say, there it is. Yeah. Yeah. It's tricky. Yeah. That's grand. Yeah. Yes. Um again I'd say this this is a physical process, not a spectral feature. Uh Yeah. Uh I don't have K_ star, but I should do. Wait, where Okay. What's wrong with broad H_ alpha? Right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's true, yeah. Yeah, that's true. Oh no, we're back to it again. That's true, but Lyman alpha forest clouds are source types we aren't marching marking. Which we don't mark, yeah. But we can just be consistent. And I don't think we are, 'cause that's not a spectral feature in the spectrum we're looking at. Yeah. But saying that isn't the same as saying we've seen that in a spectrum, whereas a broad line quasar, someone has looked at it and they've seen a broad line. But if you're discussing Lyman alpha forest clouds, they could just be discussing the physical object, which we aren't marking. Because they weren't I don't know. Anything blobby I di I didn't mark. Yeah. Yeah. I w I remembered not marking nebula or clouds or Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I think we just have to decide whether we're doing it. Yeah, but Bob's saying maybe we should be uh including nebula and clouds. But we haven't for the whole thing. Yeah. But that's 'cause we've to know it's a rather broad absorp absorption line object we have seen it. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Let's keep them. Nope. And here. Yep. Mm-hmm. There, that's derived, you're right. Oh, rubbish. Excellent. Uh you've got line brightness temperatures. Yeah. Yeah, we are. Yeah, I don't think line brightness temperatures counts. 'Cause it's not talking about a specific line. So Yeah. I don't think that counts. Feature. Right. Mm-hmm. Oh, no. Yeah, they're all the same. Yes, excellent. Um damped Lyman alpha again. Systems. That's a modifier of data. I mean that's that's a description of the type of data. A d I really don't think that counts. I wouldn't, but you would. I think just because it's got a spectral feature in the phrase, you wouldn't for example, when we were saying silicone two levels, we didn't mark silicone two. That's that's got nothing to do with the spectrum. But what this actually means is we've made some measurements based on damped Lyman alpha measurements, and they tell us this answer. And this answer is inconsistent with that answer. Yeah, I don't think that's right. Hmm? M I wouldn't, but because it's a modifier of data.. Oh feature, absolutely. B but Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Take it again, but systems should be out. Yeah. Mm 'kay. You've done it again. Yes. Right. Source type. Did we have a rule about this? Mm-hmm. Yep, that's true. That is true. Are we? Excellent. Just hitting the half an hour mark. See that i that's talking about the the flux of kin of ionising photons rather then the continuum of that spectrum. So I don't like that one. Oxygen abundance. Yeah. Mm. I'm happy enough with that. Blue-shifted. that's okay with me, I don't care. Yeah, you can have that as well. There you go. Next. Uh I think they are. I don't know why I did that. I don't like that at all. Yeah, could be that I was a bit sleepy. Lines from ions? You can't tell the difference between a line from an ion and a line line from something else. Well, you'd know where they are in the Well I guess yeah, I dunno. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's true. That's true. Alright. Yeah, but the feature itself is blue wing flux or if it was said blue wing feature, we'd mark feature. Hmm. Yeah. Possibly. Don't know. Ah uh You can point to it, but can you point to a line peak velocity shift? Well you can point to blue wing flux, 'cause you have your line and there's the blue wing flux. But if the line peak is increasingly shifted, you'd Mm there's a system issue again, so we should be consistent and keep it. Right? Yeah. Mm. Mm. I think I might agree with you. 'Cause this definitely shouldn't be marked. Because that is a process, not a A And if that shouldn't be marked, then that shouldn't be marked. Right. Oh okay. Mm. Yeah. Hmm yes. Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure either. But um. B oh yeah, either that if that shouldn't be in, neither should either of those. Mm yeah. A feature? What do you mean? Is it Uh We've marked thing have we marked things like Yeah, I don't know if we've marked things like silicone one throughout. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If we don't mark it though, we definitely shouldn't mark these two, should we? Do you agree with that? If that's true then their leaving out the word line I don't should mean that it shouldn't be marked. But But I mean, we know what they mean. Like Yeah, let's leave it in. Next. Uh Oh, is that what that means? Oh yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Seyfert two. Oh, yep. You're right. Radio loud counts, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That counts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the and this shouldn't be, should it? M m does those count as modifiers active, we definitely include active. So It's a k kind of elliptical, is it? A E_ two is a kind of elliptical. What I don't know what the J_ means. Those can does that not mean a a broad band detection? And does that count? Uh H_ alpha detection. But don't we say we don't do that? Ah. I'm right, look. Don't include modifiers of regions or systems, E_G_ region, systems. That's why I wasn't doing it. G ah, look at that. Yeah, but b uh modifiers of regions or systems is the Yeah, we could always change this if we think we're right, rather than going back through and Based on this, but we could change this rule rather than changing all those things. What's the what was the appropriate thing to do at this point? Right. Right. Right. Yep 'Cause you might have followed that rule. Right. Alright. Um Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Damped Lyman alpha systems. Ah, we're back to damped Lyman alpha data. Okay. I I do I still don't think that goes in. But Yeah. I still don't like it. But I don't have passionate feelings. Yep. Yeah, just cross those out. Oops. Excellent. So what were we looking at this page for anyway? It was for something else, H_ alpha detection. Uh Broad band detections is in don't include. Oh, so it would be a narrow band detection, a narrow band imaging detection. Alright, good. No, they aren't. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. Right. Uh, this is another systems thing. Okay. Yeah. No.. Um Yeah, absorption profiles I'll go for. Why not. Yeah, take out the blanketing. Has this Ah, right. Yep. Yeah, V_L_B_I_ is uh a net uh it's it's a V_L_B_I_ is it's a technique. It's not a yeah. What's it's called something else, isn't it? The V_O_ Yeah, it's called a V_L_B_A_. This is V_L_B_I_ network image. So do they mean the V_L_B_A_. European V_L_B_I_ net. Is it in it it's an intstru group instrument, not a research group. Yeah. Yeah. It's only supposed to be proper names. But I don't Yeah, is that so this whole thing is an instrument, you say. Oh. Oh, I see, I see. Yeah. So is this like it's a subset of the V_L_B_A_? Right. Cool. Right. Oh. That is a source name, you're right. Yeah, that's just Mm-hmm. We say something about objects, and I think it's that we don't use it. Ye Yeah, but we shouldn't have done. So that's it, yeah. Yeah, that's fair enough. It's certainly not a source name. Yeah, that means that's a proc it's a process or it's a it's a type of photons, that's not the continuum you're looking at. Sure you can, yep. Mm nope. Neither should that. Excellent. Have we agreed on that? We only agreed that so far we've only agreed that we can't include spectral features modifying nebula, but I don't see yet where it's written down that you can't mark nebula. Yeah. Yeah, but the see there's so many different kinds of nebula. I think is why I wasn't doing it. Yeah. If we're going to have them, let's have them. What's different? Oh, yeah. Um, don't mind. Mm-hmm. You're right. There. Source type. Line blanketing. Sh I no, I don't think I did I? So that yeah. Did we? Ah Um We did just have it, don't know. It wasn't that far back, was it? No, it wasn't that far back. Line yeah, we took blanketing out, so I don't think that should be in. Is that it? Yeah. Uh that's a source nine. Isn't it? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm right. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Mm the soft excess you can definitely point to on an X_ ray thing. You kn you know if there's one there or not, you could say that's that. So You're saying you wouldn't know it was soft unless you'd w oh yeah. I see what Mm. But results from spectral. Give that for red and blue components, but I wouldn't probably give that for soft component. Because a soft excess is a uh I mean that's an X_ ray thing. Like a break, you say oh look, there's Mm. Yeah. Yeah, I'd take out red and blue. Which means maybe we should take out soft. But it's such a basic sort of you look at a spectrum and you say that's a a soft excess, it's a soft Yeah. It's just a t Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's probably true, yeah. Um Hubble and Hubble deep sent to us. Yeah. Yeah. So should w did we have a soft component earlier? So we sh should kill it. No. Yeah. There it is. Right. Alright. Mm d yeah, okay. Yeah, that's fine, I'm happy with all that. Yeah.. Yeah, that counts. Do we ha did we s make a decision about radio galaxies? 'Cause I think they are discussed as a separate source type, aren't they? radio galaxies? It hides that, yeah. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Yeah. Where part of it's useful. I think you're supposed to mark the whole thing, aren't you? Yeah, so you're right. Um It's a sub-classification of Seyfert's. would make a s study Seyfert one point eights. Oh do they? You're right, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Uh yep. Yeah, galaxy and galaxy formation doesn't count. And yes, that counts. But in Yeah. Right, but I'm on the Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I don't think that should go in. Don't mind. Oh, up here. Yeah. Mm. Is it? Or is it oh, right. And Q_S_O_ is not yeah, you're right. Yep. The I_S_M_ isn't a source type. Is it? We're now including nebula, aren't we? Mm what have we done, features. Mm yep.. Okay. Nope. Yep. We aren't doing emission line objects. Oh no, we aren't doing that either, you're right. Mm no. They aren't, are they? Yeah. Yeah, anything to do with objects. So nothing. Yeah. Yes.
