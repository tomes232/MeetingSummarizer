Oops. Mm-hmm. The rapple also. No. Okay. Mm-hmm. With the link here in. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Of the value, yeah, mm-hmm. Mm of the previous r uh page rank or of the Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Mm. Okay. Mm uh-huh. So wait uh, I don't get it. You you have two representation, one which comes from this link uh stuff, and one f this one is not based on P_L_S_A_ too? Yeah. Okay. Y A T_, yeah, uh okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay, okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Ah uh okay. Yeah yeah, it's okay. Mm mm mm. Yeah. Or they use the perplexity on the the likelihood to say oh good, this likelihood is uh is it's smaller than the other. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh it's the same. I it's making the assumption that uh this human categorisation is related to the one that is discovered uh mm. Mm. Oh, yeah. No, but But I have the feeling i in But in this case you you have to use uh the label one, yeah. Your los But how does it enter in that? I i you have to train your uh Your training data. Yeah, but the point is that you should change in a way that to take the label into account, or not? Okay. Okay, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-mm. No, but w But i No. The the there is not uh v uh perfect uh clustering clus wh what is the how do you judge uh what is a good clustering? And you're not exactly compar uh. You're comparing them Ah, okay okay. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Also like a baseline, yeah. You m you still not combi No no, but it's another Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-mm. In fact I I have seen a paper in I_C_M_L_ where the guy was trying to learn which word he um aspects of clustering, so I give you I give the real users mm the person um a bunch of marbles and they begin to say okay, and they have to divide it in five group, and in the end it's not al it's it's always different to the clustering each people has, because it's completely subjective. But in but there is uh some characteristic that are for transparency, colour, which are um features that made the clustering, that can be extracted even if the clustering it's always different. So so that's only to say that uh it's it can be really infinitive clustering. Mm-hmm. Say another another example apart from uh this uh search. Uh I don't get it exactly. What you mean, then don't don't use a Google page because it's uh too uh s root, but uh another page mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Oh, it's not that People being your algorithm? That's the point? Mm. It's getting Mm-hmm, exactly. We're not trying to to fit yeah. Mm. You had onl two topics? Or no? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It was linki, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So it was a a good point for you. Mm mm-hmm mm. Like this, yeah, mm mm mm, okay. Mm-hmm. mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm, probably not, yeah. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm. Yeah mm. And Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um this alpha, i can it be dependent of the of the document? And how many text is in it? Or something uh yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm, so mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh, of course. Yeah, mm. Mm. Yeah, yeah, w w I think we've agree on that, yeah. Mm-mm. Mm. Mm probably heuristic it will be easier to compute because Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah, mm. Mm. Mm. Did you manage to to divide the link uh properly or Okay. Mm-hmm. L_D_A_. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm pyramid, yeah. Ah, okay. Yeah. Mm-mm. 'Kay. Mm-mm. In two months, yeah.
