Excellent. So um I sent you the agenda, it was on the in the project documents. I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it. Anyway, it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time, so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to. Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with, so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts, so that's we need to know about the components' properties, materials, the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching. Okay. Um, do you wanna start again? Let me we've got forty minutes. You haven't made a PowerPoint, okay. Mm-hmm. Let's hope the pen holds out. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. And charging their remote, yeah. Uh yeah. Mm-hmm. For a remote, 'cause you Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Wood, wood. A fluffy remote. Huh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Excellent. Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board, so that if we need to you can sit down, but just we might need you to leap up. What are you, PowerPoint, or Okay. Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand? Some sort of radiation? Yeah. Right, interface concept. That's fine. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. It's yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh, hi yeah. It's like the like you said, no? The scroll scroll wheel. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Excellent. Okay, straight to trends, and then we can discuss it all at once. The project documents. Excellent. If you two could both do that as well, in case we need to refer to it. Here it comes. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. That's over on the interface, if if you could put Yeah. And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing. Mm-hmm. Mm. It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen, so if you're watching something Yeah. Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure. Mm. Yeah. And then you can flip it open. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Right. Yeah, and possibly even uneven, like not not symmet yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Something a bit squishy and Yeah, and it'd help if you drop it, it protects it as well. To some degree. Uh-huh. Or if we want to use the the latex, then we have to go with one of the other um power things. From from bouncing it. You can have it as like a little ball to bounce, that flips open. Mm yeah. Uh-huh. Mm. Yeah, 'cause the Yeah. Dunno. Nothing to open them. Anything else? What've we got? Okay, so. Looking at what we've got, we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel. Yeah, rub off some of those. Yeah, it's not that's not streamlined and sexy, having a having a wind up. I think tha Depends how much how much movement it really needs. Pr presumably if they're suggesting it, then we could use it. I'd I'd keep it on. We don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable. Mm. Mm. Yeah, and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences, I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Just for fast Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it yeah L_ L_C_D_. Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_? Buttons. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what you guys are gonna do next, so if we put down the key um things that we want. Just spinning and not scrolling, I would say. Yeah. Hmm. But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing, effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side, but you folded it in half. Th that would be on one side, uh-huh. No, I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. That's right, that's what they're after. Mm-hmm. I guess. Bananas. Mm-hmm. Green. Yeah. We need the advanced yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That was the We can't have solar panels with rubber, so. Shall we go for if we're going for rubber, we think uh on as our case, and then Yeah. We've got five more minutes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost, then I'd put them in, but if it's Yeah. It's from the company, so Yeah. Okay. And the case is curved on one side, but then flat flat, so it's flipped into each other. Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer? Just so we can Nothing, it's right, I'm just There we go. Uh oh now I've gone too far. Yeah. We're on our way. Okay. So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery, the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself, um made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber. We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel, and we're incorporating voice recognition. That's our overall concept, and it's gonna look sort of vegetable, and be in bright vegetable colours. I think it's on the Mm-mm. Yeah. On the Mm-hmm. In the centre, yeah, sure. Okay, so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting. In the meantime, the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design, which I'll presume he'll work out what that means. Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation. And as well as that, the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach. Is that all okay? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder, it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it. Y ah nobody wants to talk to you. Unplug yourself. I dunno, maybe I would car
