Yep. Right. That's pretty good. Mm. Mm, I suppose it should depend on the length of the segment. Mm, I guess that would make more sense, yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, I was wanting to talk about the search. Yeah. Yeah, I'm quite keen to do like most of that. Like make an index search and stuff. Yeah, I think what basically what I need at is um just a list of words with an index to start with for each meeting. Um I suppose it doesn't really matter as long as they're unique and it can I can pass 'em back to you and you can use that to the display. Um yeah, probably. Yeah. Oh yeah, do you want you know how you've just got data for one meeting, are you needing more at the moment? Mm, I guess not. Yeah, I think we're all using the first one. Hmm. Um I think it segments quite well though, first one. Yes, it's not really important that we get it like nice and c clean or anything like that. Mm Hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah, I suppose my search will r it returned the utterance, but if you're searching for a word, you need an index for the word and the utterance as well. Um it p it'd probably select it, yeah. It would make sense to do that. Yeah. Very very basic, yeah. Yeah, yeah. If yeah, if if you can pass me like the dialogue act with Yeah, was it the speaker. And then It Yeah, that that should be enough, shouldn't it? 'Cause you can Oh yeah, I d I did that, yeah. Yeah, I d I did that as well actually. Um yes, in the data. Yeah, group data, speaker data, or something. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Is it sorry, could I d use that? At the moment it's ready to like get dialogue acts out with Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Alright. Yeah, I should maybe just get started with 'em. Making a search with that. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah of course, we've got here. That would be evil. Yeah. Oh dear. Oh. Yeah, maybe it has a different constructor when you create it. Is it? Oh yeah. I suppose. Yeah. So do you think a tree-view for like an overview of the whole set of meetings would be good? Yeah, it w it would look good. Hmm. Yeah, I suppose you could calculate them off-line and just, yeah, have a like like a l little thumbnail or something. Yeah. I mean it would be a bit pointless, but it would look good for the presentation. Yeah. I suppose. Yeah. Hmm. I've never done it, but I'd imagine it must be quite easy. Yeah, it'd be nice for a presentation, yeah, yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Is that quite easy to do to get um a moving cursor? Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was just gonna do some sort of informal evaluation. Yeah, I did say that. Yeah. Yeah, he did give us eight out of ten though. Yeah. Yeah. No I think they were ten percent each. Yeah. I think they're worth ten percent? Hmm. Yeah, I suppose he can see that we're putting the work in. I Yeah, that yeah, that interface and integration, yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, same for me. Oh yeah. Oh no, I forgot about that. Um I'm gonna do like an on-line museum archive. You get like a document for each exhibit. Oh yeah. Oh that'd be quite a good one actually. Yeah, would you have to do like music notation and stuff? Right. Okay, that's n not so. Hmm. Hmm. Well I have I've only done the first meeting. But yeah, th that's the plan. Um for the topic segments? Yeah, sorry, for topic segments I have. But for the utterances I've just got one meeting so far. But the idea was that it would be continuous. Yeah. Remember how did I do it. Hmm. I th think it should be done in the program 'cause we're probably gonna want to change it. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, we should be consistent, yeah. Hmm. Yeah, it should be easy to do, yeah. Yeah, I've got the indexes for all the meetings I think. Yeah. No, I don't think so. Yeah, I'll be working on the search, I think. It's ready to get started. Yeah, I may as well come and you can show me how it the manager works. Yeah.
