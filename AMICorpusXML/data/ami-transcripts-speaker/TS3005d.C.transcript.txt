Beep. Oh. Uh, we should save that one. Yeah, save in the folder. Save as project. Oh, okay. Hmm hmm. Agenda. Oh, sorry. Okay. Get up stand up. just 'Kay. View. Just example colour, so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype. Okay? yeah, just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible. Uh well, it's an idea in a so. Do not forget it. To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course. The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button. Okay um we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work. Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um Yeah, you push the scroll button and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available. For example uh T_V_ settings, uh remote settings, et cetera. So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button, uh as you can see oh, it's here, just push it in, uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible. Um Yeah, that's c Yeah. Indeed. Okay, um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu, uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button, and the opportunity to use the teletext, whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu, but in uh Yes. In an apart uh In a separate button, yeah. A sign, yeah, just like Okay, indeed. Okay, we can uh modify that later. Okay. Would you like to make any comments about next uh Previous page, yeah, indeed. Oh my God. It's quite large. Okay. You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen, so it's very uh when you uh when you use it, doesn't uh become irritating to see. 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu. 'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down, so Okay. Huh. Full screen. Alright. Huh. My name, my job. Sorry, you used the PowerPoint What? Bling. Now uh the single curved idea was uh Yeah, okay, you ge um Yeah. The sideways view, uh that that that ma Ho not that pen. Not that pen. Suppose so. Ah. Oh my God, it works. Yeah, that's the single curve indeed. Yep. That's not very i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom. Uh make it uh rather thick on the top, because uh on the top it has uh the screen, which takes uh in some uh space, and the batteries can be located over there, so uh Yeah. No. Yeah. Okay, indeed. Yeah. I think so. It's pretty fancy. you get th Yeah. It's true, it's a one. Very fancy. It's very true, because we designed it to be very fancy, so It's very fancy, I think. Have you ever seen a remote control like this? No, okay, so so it's fancy. Yeah. And uh uh the scroll is rubber, so s Eno enough to I think. Huh. With the ones Yeah. Take a harder look, yeah, sure. It's easier than the regular uh remote control. Yeah. Yeah, they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button. So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most Yeah. I think it's uh it's a two, at least. It's not perfect, but A three? And why is that? It said bo both the options. Yeah. A two, a two. Uh the next question the next question. Oh my God. Yeah, I was uh Yeah. I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured. Yeah, but because it has the regular uh controls, li uh as you can see in the screen now, and uh you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen. So it's t I think it's really easy to use. You want these options to Uh sure. Perhaps that is one of the most uh Uh because a lot of Channel one, channel four, yeah. Yeah, I think it does. Because all the people who can't uh Uh a two. Sure, two. Oh. Two. Give me more. No. That's definitely our uh A false, yeah. Yeah, indeed. Yeah, is optional. Huh. Yeah. Yeah, it is it is harder to to like Geez. We're getting paid. We're getting paid. Uh. Yeah, it's a three, because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible, because it has a L_C_D_ screen. Hard to lose, yeah it sh and it's easy to find. Isn't hard to lose. Isn't hard to lose, yeah. Yeah, this this is hard to lose. This Two, yeah. And most all because of the option to Whoa. Uh. put the cor cursor on the. Click. True. True. Uh yeah. Uh Materials, yeah. Uh okay. So ma uh make it make it a two. A two? I think it's two. I think it's two too, two too too. Well perhaps not. Well, n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that, but it's for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs. Yeah, the speech possibility, the colours. Scroll options, yeah. Yeah. The easy volume up button. Remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume. Turn uh turn up the volume. Two. One two three. Right. Uh. Okay, true, yeah. I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control, because when you push on the options menu, you get the the the various options uh entirely explained. Entirely explained. Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button. Yeah, you can navigate. Uh. You're not satisfied, okay. Let's start over again then. A two. Oh yeah, I think so. Yeah. And three. The average. Yeah, I think so. Save. It's a fly. Oh m Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. It i It wasn't too much. As well as the L_C_D_ screen. Whoa. Count it. You got Excel to count. Oh okay. Well I dra uh Danny, Danny, I'll do that, because I draw the uh No, no solar cell, no no no no. No hand dynamo. Hand On advanced chip. Yeah, yeah. Single nee single curved. Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional. But it isn't three dimensional, it isn't curved in a l No no no, single curved is like this. Uh that's the only curve you made, not th uh curved like that. That's uh Huh? Yeah. Yeah, we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button, because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s Not going to work? Okay. Okay um But now button supplements. We don't got the button supplements. Damn. Okay. Nah. We could lose the scroll wheel. You could make it just a regular scroll wheel. Yeah, if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button. Normal scroll wheel. Lose Okay, so we don't exactly need the single We don't need a curve. 'S possible to lose curve. Okay. Yeah, that's meant with scr uh with s curve. The curve is uh in a dimension. If you make it a flat one, s n it's no curve, you got no curves. Yeah, okay. No, two. Oh, okay, indeed. Is it possible to make No. The sample speaker is two d wait, f s four points. Yeah, uh becau uh when you lose the Yeah. No, that's no. Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood? You don't make a remote control of Ah. It isn't. What? To knock the sample speaker, yeah. And sample sensor. But m yeah, course, but What we'll have. Let's make it thirteen or fourteen. A colour. Yeah, special colours, fruity colours. Yeah. Yeah. They don't sell green rubber plants. Alright. No no no. If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen then it's possible to make. And then you can and then you can add to the colours. Special c Okay, if you lose uh if you lose the You lose this one, you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve, for example. How d uh uh how many colours? Special colours, all the colours you want, because you want to make p Yeah, but uh when you use more than one colour, it's a special colour. I suppose. Yeah. Nee we we also want to make ano another colour. Yeah, indeed, yeah. You don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote. Hmm. Yeah, single curve. Uh. Huh. Okay. Undo, undo. Undo. So, 'kay. Twenty minutes? Okay, so you had this list at start? Alright. When did you receive this list? Ah okay. Ah okay. I suppose this is a Okay, so we lose the scroll wheel, the s And the microphone. Okay. Strange. You can only re erase? Oh. Uh, no. Bling. Ah. just up somewhere b uh besides it, right. Uh, we already try. All I need is no mic. Bon chance No, add Yeah. S Difference between lines and text and the pen. Huh, looks fucking boring now. Deadlines were sometimes very short. But And stressful. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but but why not work here together, for example? Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms? Yeah. Huh, oh right. But the technology was uh fantastic. Work now? Perhaps it is e Yeah, perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there. So you can draw uh see it over th on the screen. Yeah. It's useful, but not m Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below. Alright. The project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have, you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation. So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the Oh. Wasn't me. But I didn't I uh I used it too, but oh well. Yeah. Yeah, because it shou To make some designs, it is very easy. Yeah. But to write it th yeah. Yeah, it's too big, it's too fat. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Not too much, not too too too too. Yeah, or the room for it was the idea to be creative, so You got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out. Yeah. The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late or Yeah. Was searching and searching. No, w I didn't know Make a r yeah. Yeah. No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page. No. Yeah, more information about the costs. First of all I didn't think uh that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen uh first point, but uh it was possible uh uh, yeah. Yeah. Uh. Faster laptop. Uh. They were they were just fine. Uh. Right. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, sure. Oh thank you. Bling. You're fired. Mm. You cannot you can save it. You s uh file save as the J_ PEG J_ PEG. No. No. Okay. In about five minutes. Ah. Oh thank you. Whoo-hoo. Let's let's have party. Let's have some fun. Huh? No that uh is one thousand twenty four. Yeah. If it browse. Desktop. Mm? I do not know. Oh? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Alright. Oh. Oh.
