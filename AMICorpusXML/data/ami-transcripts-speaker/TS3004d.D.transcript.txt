Oops. Mm-hmm. Means Okay. Just just one thing now. Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine. But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes. Okay, but It's rather important. Okay. Ah. Okay, there is one uh function I use uh daily, and it's not on the basic functions. It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart. Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player. That function must be Yeah, maybe Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions. And h how does the second level come out? Uh it slides uh along? From from the uh beneath? Menu? Scart? Uh yeah. And so y you keep you keep one, you have one left. Yes. Yeah. It's a f basic uh Yeah, to navigate. Mm okay. Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs? Uh and and you can hold it, you can hold it, and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons. okay. Okay, yeah. Th Yeah. If we have enough place, uh then we can do that. Colour buttons. And then we choose green, uh blue and red or Okay. Okay. That's uh Um It Some text uh buttons. Yeah, but there's one there's one text button I There's one text button I prefer. That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page, uh like seven hundred, uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred, you will switch to your television and back to text. Do you do you Did you think of that? Ex Yeah. Yeah. The sta the state you Yeah. No. Just remember where it was. It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page. If you if you turn teletext on, you you set the seven hundred, and you turn it off, then the next time you turn it on, it still stays on seven hundred? But maybe it's not the way Mm. That's maybe one thing we can discuss about. Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages. But uh not not every every television, so Yeah, I I thought about one thing. Uh the buttons? Uh from which material are they now? Okay. Because um if you use it a couple of years, some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away, are uh And maybe we can write the numbers below or above? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons? Well yeah. That's too much place. Okay, just leave it. Just leave it. Yeah, and i The most time Yeah, with rubber buttons. Yeah, okay. Okay. Fine. Yeah, I made some criteria uh, so we can uh ev evaluate our model. I d d d I don't think if it's right. That shall show it. Mm-hmm. Uh no, uh all criterias we just argue about. Uh Oh. Yeah. Evaluation crit Yeah, evaluation presentation. It's not in. Uh d it doesn't matter um It only had two pages or something. Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy, or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market. The Italians uh, how they think about it. And The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff. I made some criteria, and we have to test the criteria from one to zero. We sh we we we can give it uh a number, and then we can give ourself an average for our um model. And this These are all I I I found, or I wrote down. And um we have to discuss about, if we give it a one or a seven. Uh Yes. Yeah, the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something. And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff. The LEDs. Yes. And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of? The basic colours are black or green or yellow? Or you haven't thought about Ho how do we make uh Black and yellow. Can Black white, maybe? Uh Because um Okay, so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful? Beautiful is uh really subjective, uh because it has to do lots with the colours. Changeable fronts, so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful. Yeah. A two. Okay. The fancy look-and-feel. That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons. Okay. And we can change the colours, so that's uh really fancy I think. So Slide panel? Oh, you mean th this here? It's pretty cool. If you slide it open, it lights up. That's that's really fancy, but I don't know if it's reachable. Then we do it. Yeah, but Okay. Okay, fine. So I I think it's very fancy. So I'll give it a Yeah, and you can uh also choose your light, so I think it's one. Okay, next. Learnable? Easy to use? Yeah, we shall test it But uh Yeah. Learnable? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control. Because because I think I think the scroll wheel, uh it's very handy, but the first time you get this thing in your hands, it's not to use the scroll wheel. I think uh you must uh seek for it, and up or down or Uh then the re Yeah. Okay. Okay. But Yeah. But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things, huh? And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls. So we h we have speech, uh the scroll wheel, and um the the the slide. You must slide it. And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls. 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use. Because easy to use comes after learnable. I I think it a three or something. Oh. Okay. New features. Techno technological innovative? The speech function is new. The scrollwheel and the slide. Uh I think the slide is pretty new. Uh I only saw it in a telephone, not in an remote control. Okay. Okay, and the the the lightning? Is that new? The lighting's new. Scrollwheel. Speech? Yeah, different fronts for a remote control, I think that's new too. So we have a pretty new uh It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something. Uh-oh. Home-station. Yeah. Uh all the the seven, uh all the seven. No, we are not extraordinary new or something. Tha tha that No, we we we searched for uh um a young group, audience, beneath f forty. Yes. Yeah, but did we reach, um with our uh style, the targeted audience? Th that's my question. Yeah. Yeah. Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh That's that's That's this question. Yeah, this. So we targeted it? But we didn't follow the latest trends. Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer. Uh yeah, th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh Oh yeah. But spongy will never be. So we give ourself a three or something. Okay. That's uh What's the average? A perfect score. No, I don't know. And and you need n uh a button to call it, to let it beep. Call That's Yeah, but it No, we need that. That's usable. That's really usable. It's uh Yeah. I did save it. That's fine. Come on, it's perfect. Uh twelve point three point three. Special form, yeah. Four. It's four Euros. Yeah. So we are Okay. Yes. Or a different style. Yeah. We could make a lot of different uh remote controls. So it's creativity. Who was the leader? Yeah yeah. We were not finished. Uh. Yeah, because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now. And then Yeah. Yeah, uh everybody could speak their uh opinion. And uh Yeah. Digital pen or Yeah, the drawings are are hard to make, I think. Precise. Digital pen. New ideas. For for for To gather, or to uh work together, uh or new ideas for No, for the prototype. New ideas. Hmm. I should take some pictures uh. Yes. Let's play minesweeper. Ti-din ti-din. I'm breaking a world record here. Oh shit. We've got a problem, Paul. Yes. No it's your choice. Tu-dum. Just pick one.
