Yeah. Uh, here we have our prototype model. Yeah. Yeah, we have also some slides. In Yeah. Five. Him.. Experience. Explanat See this. You can Spongy. Hmm. So Yeah. This this is really flexible. You can add your buttons. Yeah. So function, mm So, as we discussed, we have to switch on switch off whenever we want. And so, we have buttons and using L_C_D_, or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_, and then do on and off. Then you ha you'll have volume control. So, you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume. And we have some L_C_D_ controls. Like, m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_, or you don't want you can just use normal button. And we have speech recognition. Here you have microphone, and then it date records your voice, and then it try to recognise. And it can also do the action. And location finder. And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser. You can just say, where is my remote control. Or uh, you can just give some nickname to your remote control, like Bobby. And then, it will say hi. Yeah, hi, and then you can use it. So, um our team is now fruits. Mainly strawberry. So, you can have And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches. Material, we want to stick to titanium. We will send, we want to Yeah, or s So, we want to have simple and perfect shapes, like I shown in these phones. You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs. And you can choose colours on your day for each day, or even many colours. For the L_C_D_. With titanium it's it is silver. Yeah. Mm, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood, or s And you can have many colours on weekends. Or Huh? Ah, these are like sensors.

Then we can discuss We can Yeah, then we can have how much for how money is left. Yeah. Fudge. Yeah. Fancy. Huh. Yeah, what's is really Uh, it's really Yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah. We can give at least five or six, seven. Oh, Oh. So Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. Oh, okay. So M maybe two. Technology. Yeah. Um And we have L_C_D_. So you change colours. Useful. Yeah, yeah. It's silly. Uh, still we need to cha Yeah, it Maybe strawberry. Oh. Yeah, we can easily plug it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Useful? Yeah, Yeah. Yeah, channel. I this is volume control and channel changes. These are the main You Yeah. Yeah, and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option. So if you don't want Yeah, um yeah. Yeah. And channel. You can select. Yeah mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah mm. So, d Yeah, we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_. So so Yeah. Yeah. Up. This is jog wheel. Yeah. Um, see in L_C_D_, like you will have blocks and you select which one. Yeah. Yeah. Two, maybe. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's size al almost Yeah, because it is The weight will be bit lighter. We will s We use titanium. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Heavy. Yeah. Yeah. But sides uh, the sides should be okay.. Yeah mm. Oh. Yeah. The case is silver titanium, no? Yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So maybe, I think Yeah. Yeah, well Yeah. Um Yeah, well then it's bit difficult to use. Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction, too. So, maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges, stuff for strawberries and different colours. So it's Even These buttons But it looks really not really good. I mean, the f Yeah. So these are kind of rubber things. Even if you lose one you can just put whatever. Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits, and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here, so we just Yeah, so even if you don't put, it works. But this is really fancy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Three, three, six, eight, eleven. Hmm.. Yeah mm. Yeah, two one one seven, we have. So Financi Energy. Uh, we use bat One battery. Yep. Oh, we just need one, I guess. No, number is one. We need only one battery. Number, number. So we We have sample chip. Uh, like simple chip, yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Four buttons at least. And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition. Yeah, one to one. Yeah, one. Yeah, I think we will go for a single curve, no? Oh, is Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh. Titanium. Yeah, well No, only one, no? Um Interface. Yes, in L_C_D_ display. Ok Yeah, an Yeah. Push-button. Scro Uh, two. Yeah. One scroll wheel. One L_C_D_ displayed. Yeah. Yeah, it's cheaper. Yeah.
