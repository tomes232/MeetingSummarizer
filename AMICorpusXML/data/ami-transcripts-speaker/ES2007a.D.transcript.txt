Is that alright? or Okay. Keeps coming off. 'S fiddly. Right. Oh, another one. Ah. Very nice. 'Kay. Okay. Clip. Ah. It's an elephant. Oh my gosh, I'm never gonna be able to draw that well. Does it? Oh. Mm. I have no idea what my favourite animal is. Oh. It's A what? Alright. How. No. Great. Me? Okay. Not quite sure how this is gonna work. Cool. Uh well I'll try my best to draw. Can I just draw the face? Ooh. It's a cat. Which also has what? A big fat body and big and a long tail. Why? Because um cuddly. And usually cats are very friendly. Usually. And they're healing as well. They heal. And they can feel when a human's got problems so So, that's why I like cats. There we are, that's me. Mm. Mm-hmm. Ah. Market range internationally sold. Ah right okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control. Well. A new remote control for T_V_. What would I like? Um. Medium. Mm. Twelve fifty. Each. Guess Couldn't we have like one that comes out? Like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick. I mean remote controls can be thin bits. And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out, and then you have another one, you slide it out. have slides. And then it all comes compact into one. So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner, and um into one basically. So you just flip them out. That would be cool. I was thinking that like a flip. Okay. Um.. But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though? I mean if it's if it's just like Mm-hmm. Mm. I think a flip up thing, 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway, like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach, and you'd come and sit down and ooh, the telephone's the television switched on or something. So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes, so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something. Yeah. But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it. So make it Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. And even for kids as well. It's um it's safer for them, I guess. Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto. Mm. W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for? Ah ri okay. these are requirement specification. And I'm marketing. These are requirement specification. So what the user requires in a remote. I guess that's what it says. Mm. So, do we take these off?
