Funky sh stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. Look at all this stuff man. Okay. Right. Has anybody Has anybody done anything? You better start. Good at this. Right. D yeah. The l the left-click or the right-click. Right. Yeah, it might be quite good, I suppose. Yeah. What else could we have in the menu? Okay. So otherwise you just have a right-click or do you have have a Is a window. A menu, yeah yeah. Yeah, it's why. And so it might be a bit weird the fir to just start bringing up stuff and then it Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's more It's more idiot proof, isn't it. It's got a button. Add more buttons. Yeah. Well in uh I guess in in In meeting browser one point one, you can have a menu instead of a button but this why I don't think it Yeah. Yep. I guess so. So what did you part of the m the menu that comes down, it says give me all your meetings or something. Yep. I guess so. It's an idea. Get to use my pen. Yeah yeah. Oh yeah. We have to have a speaker characterisation first before we cross any of the other bridges. So yeah, there you go. Yeah. Alright. Why not. Even if only one thing comes up. Okay. So and so this lot is for um On the t speaker. And then this lot is on th What was that? I didn't quite understand. Do you mean Yeah. Oh, so and it figures out what's the most common use to double-click. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Sometimes you do it by accident though. You, oh go away. Stop coming up. Yeah. No. Yeah, yeah, oh yeah. T throw stuff throwing out the window. Yep. We don't know yet do we, I don't think. Do you mean the single channel? Probably not, but we might need them for disfluencies, if we try do it in audio. But at the moment, no. But yeah. We might want to be able to say oh, just give me what that person's saying. Unless um you can't hear it properly or something. Somebody's talking over somebody else or something. Well p W we just say no for now and put it in later or something. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, 'cause otherwise it will the it will increase the amount of data we need by a lot, won't it? Therefore print will be bigger. Yeah. No, I think it's I think it's fine. Yeah. I think what we're doing is fine. Yeah, tabs are good. Mozilla style. Yeah. Does anybody know how to do that? Or can you do that in Java? I don't think Java knows how to do that really. Maybe yeah, you probably can. But but If you really knew what you're doing. But I don't know. It's a bit of a cripple with Java's windowing tool-kit. The eight is sometimes it's a bit of a cripple. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that will reduce the number of um windows we needed, wouldn't it? Which is quite good. 'Cause otherwise Photoshop has a lot of windows, if you ever use Photoshop it's got loads, and you're always g forever going no, get out of the way. There's always stuff in the way, isn't there. So Yeah. You do, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Unless, can you I don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that Can you can you do that? Okay, well it's alright then. Yeah. Of course you can actually, yeah, it's got everything. Yeah, sounds good. Um Yeah, that's what we need, yeah. Something just slightly more than just that on its own. Yep. Yep, definitely. I think that's kinda as well, isn't it really? Seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be a prototype with a GUI. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You can make it if you make it world readable, then anybody can access it. Yeah. No, uh i i it no, they're not world-readable. It not the default they're only default then only you can read them by default. You can see them but you can't read them. Yeah. What's your number? Okay, your number. Okay. And then it's N_L_S_S_D_. The M_ browser, for meeting. Hope you hope you never have to look in my directory. It's just pure chaos. S Mine is serious chaos. Files everywhere. Don't all jump at once. Yeah. Yeah, what was on it. Oh you found some code for it. For the inde Alright. Alright. Cool, cool. So even if it doesn't work, you can jiggery pokery around and make it work. Y yeah. Yeah yeah. All sorts of nonsense. But yeah. By the basics is uh oh okay, that's good. Yeah. I've been trying to g write something to read the X_M_L_ and get rid of it. And I can get rid of it, but I'm having trouble putting it anywhere else. So it will come up on the screen For the moment I haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in Java to play with it. But I guess it's not very difficult. Yeah, in Java, yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah, I'm sure they do. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah, I will. I'm sure it's nothing difficult. I'm sure I'm making a meal of it at the moment actually. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely, yeah. Should share as much as possible. Yeah Yep. Next week sometime, yeah. I actually haven't done anything this week 'cause this week's been manic. But well, whatever it was, last week then. The the the week as it as is rather than the proper week, do you know what I mean. Do you know that, it's been all a bit manic, the last m the last yeah. Yeah, that's right, yeah. And then we had to do an I_R_P_, whatever it was last week as well. Which is only a page long, but it's quite difficult to write a page. More diffi it was, it wasn't marked, but it was I had to sit there and think about it for a bit, which is a bit irritating. Yeah, but S_P_N_L_P_. Yeah. Yep. So when it when it That's pretty bizarre, isn't it? Well I guess that's how it works. They've got d That is pretty bizarre. Yeah, yeah. That is pretty bizarre. Wh Four, and it w it li it just has an open variable transparent s list, whatever, find everything that's got that and then load Yeah. Yeah, yeah, 'cause that's the uh the declares a variable, doesn't it, and then they keep Okay. Right. Oh see, obvious So did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it, is that what you did? Right. Okeydoke. Fish the data, I was just thinking that, yeah. Mm. Have you annotated your code nicely? Not yet. Just in case. mission critical. Yeah. Commen commenting it out one bit at a time and running it, does it work, yeah. Okay, get rid of that, next. Good fun, aye. So basically we go and go and do some work really, I think that's the um the um the answer to that, isn't it. The long and the short of it. Yeah. Proba I'm still at the bottom of the mountain. Yeah. Well, should you find you want to explore any other perhaps you as your um uh quantify raising. You saw it, yeah. So what courses should I pick to be not doing any work at the moment? Yeah. Oh, so it's uh, yeah. Yeah, me too. Um. So so what's that, two weeks basically. Ish yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's it's quite impressive actually. Yeah. That's quite slow really. Yeah. No, it's not, is it? Yeah. Can take us for a tutorial sometime. Next week sometime. Mm Monday afternoon. Uh Three is alright. It was what time's D_N_L_G_? Four, isn't it? Three's good though. I'll but we have s whatever. What's you what would you prefer? We could three thirty in the in the computer room in here, and then we can just go stra if you can't can you get in the front door? Oh, you haven't got a key, do you? Can none of you get in there? The k the f there's computer rooms in here, the M_S_C_ computer lab and uh is in here. Well if you find me, I'll show you where I'll I'll let us all in there, and we can all go in there. Yeah, yeah. You do need to have a key for it. Like that's the thing. It's got a lock door button. Yeah, somebody will answer it. Yeah, it's only got it's crap, it's only got about four or five computers in But it would do quite good for our job, 'cause it has not very uh p not many people in it very often. Yeah, there's fridge there. And there's a photo-copier with the code on it, yeah yeah. It's cool, yeah. Oh right. Yeah, yeah. Hopefully it's not that man, so it won't matter. Some classes did and some classes didn't. It's all a bit bizarre really. They didn't really know what was going on. Nah, make 'em work. Done. Oh, we trust you. Yeah, I think the comments are basically the same as what you said. So it's Yeah. Oof. Bu buzzes. Yeah. Signing off, innit? Log off.
