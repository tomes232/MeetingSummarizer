A lapel is also there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's better. Uh you go to the table, you have there like the big table, you told and then we can discuss. So which I think I have all the gammas, no? Especially gamma full models I have. Yeah, posteriors And posteriors. Even you have those three state perform gammas also, you have all these Huh. Ah okay. So now yeah, now you can write another paper if you can Gammas to posterior. I two hundred. Two hundred millisecond. So but for numbers I think it may be okay, numbers hardly yeah. one two. Even less than that, yeah. Just few words, like so but if for or something, like if it's really long sentence of ten seconds or something, you may not really need so much con I know, it's really computationally very intensive also, like if you use So pretty much all the posteriors are from you only. Sk Oh, you know. But al for your case you don't need really complicated posterior, you just need some P_L_P_s and then. No, but but ma he's he may be linking to Matthew I guess, because Matthew got the wav files. But you got the all the wav files, so. Yeah, so that's what I'm saying, like Uh yeah. Yeah, yeah. So if he got features then it's okay, otherwise if he has to generate again, he can't generate. Yeah. So Because Yeah. But the p everybody has features in temp, only most of the time all the C_T_S_ features or C_T_S_ wav files, so. So forget about C_T_S_, at least now I think because it's again It takes at least one or two weeks. But segmentation. But you say do you need to do some segmentation also, on top of that, so. They're Yeah, the we can wait at least one or two weeks for this, because it's But still, I think we can't really do these things before ICAS because yeah. So maybe we can concentrate work especially on numbers now and then we can go to C_T_S_. So in numbers case, what do you really need like? Yeah, basically yeah, w we need to generate again P_L_P_s, but wave files are there. Yeah, P_L_P_s But you're generating P_L_P_s from? Um Mm. But at least you f Yeah. Yeah, that you can del But at least, yeah, you have something to verify their wa. So so P_L_P_s or these are all thirteen just only P_L_P_s, not deltas and del Yeah. But if you got something from Hemant or Matthew then I have those number of stage, like we have then you know like it's only for only close uh D_C_L_, K_C_L_ they have. No, he he got from you only. Ah. I think so, yeah, so then I have those number of stages. Yeah. Ah, okay. So Ah. So you didn't have any P_ for these P_L_P_s, no P_L_P_s or P_ files from P_L_P_. So bu what about this noise levels, like we have noise wav files in da da COM databases. So we have directly f wave files with uh particular noise. Ah ok see No, but but I think uh de But Hmm. But the problem is like all this I think it may not be there in database, I guess. Oh, okay. You called the noise X_ database. Ah, okay. Even with uh S_ and R_s. Ah, okay, then it's okay. Ah. So y you it's not that you all the no. Yeah with S_ and R_, different S_ and R_s. Yeah, so at least we have wave files, so now we can generate anything in the P_L_P_s or so at least Yeah. Those But for all these S_ and R_s, so that's also again Hmm. No, the thing is like you can't really write this k I suppose uh the code is the real problem, scripts is okay like, yeah. Even scripts also the configurations or you do if you forget something, some factor or something, it's really Which disk? Uh three disk. Mm-hmm. So it should be replaced by Ah, ok Mm-hmm. Yeah, Hmm. It will ri Uh it will have measures like Uh. Hmm, but like this. But even this maybe really huge data also. I think maybe some companies definitely do insure you can't really have so many backups Which just partition these uh. Hmm. But Yeah. But uh we we Hmm. Yeah, no temp. Uh so then then Hmm. But is it really costly, the system is Hmm. Maybe at least they will give some number others, like they can. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, at least they they will know m beforehand I think uh. Yeah, yeah. Mm but even like how much important data l sometimes it's just M_P_ threes or something, so you don't really need to Fo four tera, no? Four tera, it's like Mm-hmm. Yeah, four thousand gigabytes. Yeah, it but now we got something like uh more than fift No, RAID five is better, I think. It l it levels. Uh ah, okay. Mm-hmm. But RAID five is then then twenty percent copy only. Ah,. It's not the other way. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it will be then the other disk. Yeah. Yeah. Again. scaling. And also maybe like this noise is he was Mm, this is not in the paper actually d This is Hmm. Yeah. At least now he can know a full system setup from Yeah. So now mainly like uh thirty nine P_L_P_. You were always thirty nine, no? Not sure But then why did this features you gave me like they're thirteen? You truncated them to No no no no, these these these ones like the Ah, okay. Hmm. Ah. Ah, okay. deltas. Ah, okay. Ah, ok Hmm. Yeah, those results only you reported in Interspeech, no, like uh thirty nine P_L_P_ results. Uh. Uh they were, but they were less than ten percent or so. Now, even the clean speech you are getting No no, this is just Uh n no he gave scale to me, then I generated gammas. Even uh No no no no. The they're differently. Yeah. Yeah, because I have triphone G_M_ G_M_M_s and H_M_M_s. So he gave me scale likelihoods of triphones. Scale likelihood. Scale likelihoods. From triphone memory. Hmm. So then again I will pass through full network. Then I can generate triphone gammas. It's like. It's no no, it's uh it's just G_M_M_ word models. You have all the connections to between all the words, like hmm. So then first thing is like we need to generate P_L_P_s, and then all these S_ and R_s P_L_P_s. Hmm. No, it was there on uh like uh yesterday morning also like even. So I was running some experiments and then it was okay, but it's readable only, so I can't write anything, so. Yeah, so but we don't know, like we thought like I thought it's recovering, so maybe by tomorrow I'll get everything, so. Uh so if you want a copy again, you'll have But yeah, still some people are in vacation, so they will really Pedro Pedro also Hmm. But even all over the recent iteration, iterate training set in temp. Because like we we s how much we can copy, because it's really so many iterations and even we thought of really completing minimal experiment also mm. But at least, yeah, a script are there every scripts, like at least scripts are there but so if if they can decode Yeah, if they can decode at least Hemant's P_ files then Hemant can Yeah. But C_ files yeah. Even if they give you P_ files, it's really better, even you don't really need to ru run all the Yeah yeah, you j just only like recent P_ files at least. No no no. Yeah. But still I think I it depends. Uh in Edinburgh they had that big fire and then Even even sa several uh da buildings and all the computers in that building they all burned, but they have like three backups in the university, so all these people, they didn't really affect much. No, it's the university is maybe it's really big, so they can afford for Yeah, they yeah yeah, they want th they'll have backup in different and also in in some in underground, so that like file proof or something, yeah. Yeah, maybe. No, C_D_s are not enough like, no. Yeah, how much uh Hmm. Hmm. But what about home directories or he also kept everything in uh temp. Yeah. But he he did mostly on numbers, no? So at least if we can recover we we can read some of his stuff or something. Did you locate it? It is home or home speech or something. Look for any features or anything are there. No no, he he maybe he might be using same P_L_P_ features or something, it they are different. We don't know it. Uh his own Ah okay, is here, he got uh his own Yeah. Uh Hey. Hmm. Oh then it's good, you know like we don't really nee So but your P_L_P_ is also like Mm-hmm. Then we just need to run your neural net only yeah, but P_ P_ P_L_P_s are like hardly few minutes li Mm. Which which scripts? And then But but you still need to run all the nets no l? It's No, but it's it's not I think at least it takes two hours or three hours I think. you can't parallel also, that's the problem. He Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So for example if he want repeated all these results, then he ju he need to use all ma Hemant's P_L_P_ configuration then that's really Yeah, the results will be Then you don't you don't know uh uh well. Yeah, for thirty five, forty minutes it is. Uh uh thank you. It's all?
