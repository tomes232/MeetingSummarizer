No I'm going to listen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Speech coding. No. Yeah. Yeah well that's uh yeah. So Uh well uh so basically I started reading about the features that's taking the long temporal and uh time frame, that's uh TRAPs. And uh tandem approach. Yeah, s yeah, yeah. So then I also started with the there was a paper on uh fitting a ear model to the D_C_T_ of a signal. Started with that and slowly getting used to the stuff. S Yeah. Uh I think yeah, yeah. It's uh the paper by Dan Ellis and co. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A_S_R_U_. Two thousand four I guess, yeah. Two thousand three, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So for Yeah.. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So then I continued with uh another uh paper that you are mentioning, L_P_ TRAP. So I just moving around with that ideas. And also uh the main idea today why I told maybe is like if you can list down what all things are there to be taken care of. Then one by one. Because finally face find I do have something else. So uh maybe to list down the things other than the what I've already taken from you. And also to discuss generally. Yeah. Yeah. Feature extraction. Part tandem training. 'Kay.. So yeah, right now I have the feature extraction part where I can get the phoneme posteriors and through the neural net. So then I think I need yeah. Yeah, i yeah, but uh yeah, it's T_K_ through for some other task I've run it's T_K_. So I have the general feel. But uh maybe I can take the interceptor from you and run it once on my to have it. Yeah. So Yeah. Basically. So then I can can share what I ca have read and uh Yeah. Yes. So I'll use this. Yeah, the Let's do the feature extraction that we have already taken, then the back-end for that. Then? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh so yeah.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Traps I know. But though with various? Okay. Length. Ah. Okay. Frame. Okay. Filtering, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay.. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. It's alright. Yeah. Yeah, that's ri Yeah. So compression basically you are looking at I guess, yeah. Mm-hmm. Coding.. Yeah. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Mm-hmm. No, that's for compression. I don't need for for compression you basically don't need the. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And P_L_P_. Triangle. Uh yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. The speech signal, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Because Yeah, use maybe you can use the board for that, yeah. Can we remove this when you are going to this place? Oh. Periodic pulse, yeah. But this is uh Yeah. This is like a residual for him. Yeah, in the for uh frequency it is. For any object you measure you use for uh a reconstructed signal and uh Uh-huh. Yeah. H_P_. So what is the compression factor we are getting here? Uh-huh. Okay. Yes.. Mm-hmm. To fit the the Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Coming back though. Yes. Yes. Envelope, yeah. Yeah. Uh one thing I wanted to know is any um a good literature on these lines. Uh where you started with, yeah. Yeah, that's one yeah, o uh th oh. I have two with the Interspeech paper I Pattern? Okay, okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. So Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Yes. Uh yeah. Well, regarding this F_D_L_P_. Yeah, He doesn't send. Yeah. Yes. Yes. So Yeah.. November? Okay. Yes.. Yeah. Bu three I mean four credits? Or uh a total of four. Ah. Yeah. Because s s in I_S_ it's four uh credits and uh Guillermo is taking I think he's g yeah. Notebooks. Mm-hmm. Where was this? In okay. Yeah. But I can come to yeah. Later. Okay. Uh-huh. Yeah. So in case I need something on this F_D_L_P_, I'll come to you? Uh yeah? Okay. Okay. Takes your uh Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yeah, thanks.
