With the logo and our uh l uh No I don't think And the And about the side view um This the front won't be as thick, but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh Well, it won't be visible. Mm? Yeah. If y If you handle a remote, you you usually don't have your hand straight like this. You you have it a bit uh Yeah. Yeah. Well, they lay there all the time. Yeah yeah. Yeah you you don't you don't grab it, you you Yeah. Hmm. That way, it it falls into your hand. I think. No but but Well f for as far as I can see, three of us agree and only Nils But you're the Project Manager, you can make the hard decisions. Yeah? Mm. But what about the redesigning? Okay. Hmm. Mm. Well we designed it to be good-looking. Hmm. Yeah. We designed it to be good-looking, so Hmm. I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long, because I don't know how how many points there are but uh Yeah. Yeah. Um, no it's uh With two huge buttons. Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something, because of the colour. But We have so few functions, so Yeah. Well, I should I think two, because the voice recorder is n not self learning. Yeah. Yeah. The Two two. T Yeah. One or two, another two. Well three. Mm. Yeah. This is the last meeting? Yeah. Yeah. The what? Oh. Um Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip? Yeah? Can't we do that with a regular chip? Why not? Yeah. Regular is normal. Simple. Elementary. We we we Why? We have very little options furthermore, for the Uh well we have to put that in. Nah. Yeah, you must change the chip uh back. You must change the chip back, Nils. Hmm. No we oh You you we have an advanced chip-on-print, and we have an L_C_ display. I think that's a bit double. Y we don't need both. Says. I?? One curve. Well we make it more expensive to buy. Yeah or we could replace it Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium, uh titanium-coloured plastic? Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper. But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again. Ah no no. It's not ugly looking. The looks remain the same. Well, I do think so. feel. Yeah alright but then we we won't get there. We can dump the special colour. We l we use plastic. And plastic is already in colour I think. No, nothing. Amen. Yeah. Yeah. But No no no no. W Titanium stays there. Well No because we did not know anything about it. Yeah, but then we've got money left. Yeah. Yeah. W Well I think uh the case is double curved then. Because you y have that curve and you have that curve. Yeah well uh Well y we have curves in all directions. I mean, this this ain't titanium, but it looks like it. Pro project. Yeah. Yeah. And uh unrealistic. Well we we we used our creativity, but we just had to adapt it to the costs. Nei. Uh no. Terrible. Leadership? Well Yeah. Yeah. Right yeah. No, that's a SMARTboard, and that's a digital pen. Or not? Oh they're both SMARTboards. Yeah. But I I think this is meant by the digital pen. Yeah. Well we we used that one, and we needed it. I think. Yeah alright, but Yeah I like that one, but that one is terrible. Well I I drew this. Mm. And I made a mistake. But it it would have been uh useful, if I I could show this on the screen. Yeah for drawings. N notes mm. Mm. Yeah. But then uh it's really useful, I think. Yeah. Hmm. Thanks Project Manager. Well I did. Well I missed uh the option to uh to email, yeah. Email or chat or something. Yeah alright, but that's one n new idea. Yeah. No it isn't. Yeah. So it isn't useless. Yeah. Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand. With the mouse it is No. Uh indeed.
