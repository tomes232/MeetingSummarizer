Yeah. Yeah, we'll go we've got the mailing lists out now, isn't isn't it. So it's everyone should know about it now. Yeah. So so everyone on that list has now being reminded. Yeah, don't store anythi anything sensitive on yeah, don't store anything you you care about on the machines. So Yeah, with the yeah, I mean I di I di I did do hard dri hard drive check um and a memory check, and it says there's no uh there's no problems, but something caused it to go wrong in the first place. So we don't know, we don't know. We'll just fingers crossed and hope ho yeah ho hope that all this is just a software thing that we can just fix like that and that'll be it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean there's there's so what we yeah, one one for one. One we'll try and get done today, yeah, get get Windows back on there. Try and get Camtasia on there and get that tested out, and then that will be I think that's everything we need f before we can before you can start running the experiments, isn't it. So Yep. Yep. Yep, yep. Uh but uh yeah. No, I have to manage to get at things working on on Monday. So that that everything went down like on the Tuesday morning. Um so my m I should get everything working on the um, yeah, on Monday, so sure that the J_C_T_ is actually working, collaborating collaborating between the two machines. Um I had dinner I wasn't actually at dinner but I d have the eye tracker stuff working, 'cause it was just me running roun running round the lab. Um still have to once it's re-installed have to actually do a proper p yeah, of proper pilot and yeah. Yeah. But um but it loo it looks like it was doing all the calibration and drift correction things that s Ellen was wanting on it. So So that don't think there's anything to add to the software for that part. Um Don't think so. Mm. Don't s don't sound don't sound familiar. Yeah. Yeah, so I'll try and try and get Camtasia up and running so I can try it out when when when we've got her coming in. And we'll just sort of do a run-through of proper pilot just to just just so I can see th Yep. Yep. Um yeah, I'll make sure make sure they can actually pick up the f um audio signal as well. Uh so but uh it should be the yeah, the audio signal should be coming out the speakers once it's set up properly. So that should that should make that slightly easier. Yeah, yep. Uh but yeah, so they're fortunate have speakers o on the monitors inside the room. So as long as and what we'll have done is just gonna set up so the uh whatever the asterisk sound is on Windows is what gets played. So so just change sound to whatever you like, just go through the Windows control panel. Yep, yeah so I'll I'll have that running over the weekend. Um so la last week I tried it with a one kilo-hertz sound. Um and it was it c it could detect it, but it wasn't but but it wasn't very clear. Did it with ten kilo-hertz and it's just really clear, where you can tell exactly where exactly where the beep is now. So yeah. So tha it's ju just a matter of um yeah, you just ba basically just play it, just play a ten kilo-hertz sound over the over the speech and then just um compare the two signals basically. Um so I've I've got a little script for doing it. So So Yeah, yeah. Yep, yep, not a problem. Yep, yeah, the the one the one in just installed should have that now. Um we'll double we'll double-check and re-install on software on the on the um eye tracking machines. But yeah, it should uh should be updated without any. So Yeah, so so so we've got like uh a big circle with a white circle in the middle of it for an eye. And we got like a rectangle with two like rectangle buttons on it for a mouse. So Uh no, they're they're they're the same size as the as the original blobs basically. But um so they uh yeah, I think the mouse is slightly bigger, but it's not, you know, it's not it's not hugely bigger. So Yeah. And if it ever ever gets to be a problem in the pilot I can easily reduce the size of whatever. 'Cause that's not too hard. So Yeah. Yep,. Yeah. Uh I'll try it. Yeah, yeah. So so you can you can do it in X_ fig, export them as S_V_G_, and you just get a you just get a list of X_Y_ coordinates. Um and then I'll just write in a little script that turns those X_Y_ coordinates into a part. Well the thing is it's S_V_G_. So so long as I've got something that will output S_V_G_. Yeah, yeah. So I'll als I'll also have a look have a look at that. But the there's there must be plenty of Windows things for th that I o output S_V_G_. Min uh I kno I know I know Um I kn I know Adobe and things have faculties that do it. But obviously they're like a few hundred pounds. Um so, oth but other I I'd b I'd be very surprised if there wasn't a free package for doing it. Um I ha I have a feeling that the um Amaya, the W_ three C_ browser, does it. Have a feeling that that can actually edit S_V_G_ files. Yep, yep. Yep, fair enough. Yeah. Um when will yeah but no I'll I'll create a c I'll create a convex part um just so next week um ju yeah, but it just it it just just happened to be a convex part that I was that I was I was playing with. So it it handled that fine. Um it didn't have any self-intersections, so that might be a problem. So I'll just have to have check that. But Yeah, by by a by a part of it crosses over itself. Um s so it's sorta like a b Yeah, that sort of thing. Yeah. So Yeah. If if it if it becomes a yeah. Yep. Yeah, so for now we'll just just assume that non-interse non-intersecting um and um yeah, and then there's this at the moment the e the S_V_G_ stuff can output ones which aren't closed polygons. But um ones ones you ones that actually had turn up into parts list uh it creates a closed polygon by linking the l end point to the start point. So so uh, yeah, so as long as long as they're yeah, so so so as long as they're they're drawn well enough, it should be alright. So um but yeah, suppose let Nijmegen uh find their find their own S_V_G_, sort of find something that does S_V_G_ and then we'll see if there's any problems. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But it mi it might be worth just checking what software they are using 'cause it might crea it might create outputs slightly different from X_ fig. So Yeah. That should that should be fun. Yeah, I think it does S_V_J_ uh S_V_J_ output. Um so I'll I ca I can easy double-check if uh Nijmegen can't find anything. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but other than that that was easy enough to install though, wasn't it. It was yeah. Copy and paste the stuff out the off off the Wiki. So Yeah. Yeah, I mean uh also double-checked in that we're not gonna w could access the C_V_S_ from home when I was working from home last last week. Um on Thursday I managed to managed to get in and just just check the stuff and make sure it was all make sure th make sure ma make sure I could access it. So they shouldn't have any trouble accessing it once they've got the log-ins. So Not yet, I'm afraid. Uh well on once uh once I've tried out the Camtasia stuff, I'll see if the if there's any problems, gonna tr gonna try and fix them. If there isn't any problems, next time I'm working on this uh G_D_F_ stuff um so so I've I've I pu uh put on a D_T_D_ and a sample X_M_L_ file on the Wiki for the G_D_F_. So it's ba based on some stuff you put on there on the G_D_F_ specification. Um Yeah, I mean with I cha I changed a couple of things from your original draft. Um so there's not uh there's no longer a separate thing for creating new parts. So just put a start and end time on each part. Uh so So the the you you you had a you had a thing call I think it's mould or so or something that you said which is sort of to create a new part. There's an action to create a new part. Um but I th uh I've I gave each part a start time and an end time um so you can see when the parts were created. So I'm not su so I'm not not sure if you wanna keep the mould or not. Uh Yeah, but it's it's just the G_D_F_ specification page on the uh on the Wiki. I've uh I mean I'll try try to put in justification for for the change that I made uh on the page. So um but I've I've sent it out for review so that s anyone who is gonna using the format can have a look at it. Huh. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mind, when the Yeah. Well the ones that this stuff, I mean, is it's helpful. It was helpful for me to putting it up on the Wiki 'cause I could actually thin think about it as I put it up and say well this is this is why and th this is why I wanna do things this way. Um so Yep, yep. Yep. Fair enough, fair enough. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Well uh well I kn I know on Camtasia, if you got a ca if you've got a Camtasia project, you can have the video and audio stored separately. In which case Yeah. So yeah. So so we just ended the just ended the the Dutch stream, yeah, the video and our audio. And then they can easy create their audio out of mm from that outp Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah.. Yeah. Well one thing uh one one thing that Camtasia can do, you can have little videos when other haven't gotten got any cameras for doing that. But you could like have videos of people click on the mouses and sorta or whatever else, mm-hmm. You can do yeah, you can generate call-outs and whatever. So The might yeah, I'm sure there must be a way of putting big arrows ov or whatever. Um Oops.. No, I'm an af afraid not. I wouldn't know. No. No, no. That's a s that's psychology thing how hard they Yeah, yeah, so this yeah. Yes, yes. He'll he'll just be working with Robin on what analysis we need to get out of the G_D_F_ format. Um so I'm gonna c basically I've got a the gest analyser's the base the basis for uh um ASCII to G_D_F_ converter. Um so what I'm gonna do is actually create an output uh a G_D_F_ output part to it. Um 'cause at the moment uh only outputs the video. Um but it does have internal structures will just make it easy to do the the X_M_L_. So so that's that's what I'm gonna look at. And then once I've done that I can look at the whatever analysis we need to get done out of the G_D_F_. Yep. Yeah, yeah. Yep. Yeah.. Um I think that's it. And I'll t uh yeah, I'll get get working on the Camtasia stuff this week and then so once uh once uh once we've got some some idea about what analysis you want out of this, I can think about whether G_D_F_'s got everything we need in it. Um and f yeah, what analysis we can pull out of it. Yeah, yeah. So I'll I'll double-check the G_D_F_ specification against that just to make sure it's got everything you said that you'd you say you need from that list. Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause they I mean we w we got all this in the ASCII format at the moment and it's just a matter of what data do we need to pull out of that into the G_D_F_ so I can actually do the proper analysis. Um 'cause I think all the answers are gonna be run off the G_D_F_ format 'cause 'cause we've decided that if we went and looked well if we're looking at dynamic reasons and whatever else, it has to be G_D_F_. Yeah. Which is yeah, which is why we have to do it off the G_D_F_ as as opposed to the E_D_F_ format. So Yeah, yeah. So so the G_D_F_ it's got yeah, so it's it's got uh the all th the stuff on the um E_D_F_. So it's just the uh the ASCII file the things like the mouse movements and things like that. And then yeah, yeah, and then on top of that G_D_F_ can also it will also have information such as, right, at this point in time they were looking at the new parts area or they were looking at the target. Yeah. Um so yeah. So the the G_D_F_ is gonna have that sort of information in it. And then also 'cause it's X_M_L_ file, we can then do X_S_L_T_ or whatever on to it to get extract whatever bits of data you need for yeah, for for whichever bits of analysis you're trying to do from it. So Yep.
