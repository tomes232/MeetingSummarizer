Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, right. Where should we start? What have we got? Mm-hmm. Yeah, right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. I thi separate course is good idea. That's Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Yeah. Yeah, when in doubt. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right. But the the text for the actual call, is she going to re-work something or uh she should Mm-hmm. I think she might be glad to see kinda there linguistics to adapt. That's always quite helpful. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Ab Not certain anyway. They know her. That's that thing. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I w well let's send out the call as soon as possible, see what reactions we get. And then See if we have to put on some restraints. Let's see. Mm. Up to three, but don't exaggerate, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I'm thinking if we go for say I'm thinking uh slots of one and a half hour each. So three lectures each, that would be uh three per day times three will be twenty seven. Mm-hmm. Once in the morning, twice in the afternoon. Yeah. I mean or twice in the morning once in the afternoon. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was about to say, poster session is a good idea because just the people presenting the posters are there and can say something about it. Actually there's always the problem again then the people who are presenting the posters don't get around to go and look at others' posters. But let's see about that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Do we have any information on this? First years. Oh. Actually, we have a message here from Mits about the poster session. Poster session was introduced in nineteen ninety nine as part of the main conference. In two thousand it was held separately in October. The intention was to use it as a way to introduce incoming post-grad students to the department's research culture. However, I did not pursue this idea the following year because the comments I received from students in two thousand were generally discouraging. On the other hand, I later learned that some students did find the October poster session quite a useful experience. My suggestion therefore is to re-examine the idea of poster session altogether and find a better way to implement it if there seems to be enough interest in it. Mm. Yeah. Last sentence. One possibility is to put it back in the main conference and let people choose between a paper presentation and a poster. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. But a poster I might do. Mm-hmm. All these dead linguists. Mm-hmm. Um write into the call that we are considering the idea of having a poster session. So people can indicate would they prefer to give a poster or a talk. But the ultimate decision is on our side because we have to see how it does it work out with the poster session, how does it work out with the talks. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Just throw a general suggestion at them. See what happens. I think they do. Still Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, might be interesting stuff coming in. Read something recently about I think somebody's Masters project to look in how far English is actu uh or in how far English is a shaping influence on programming languages. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of Yeah. Or some some relevance clause. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Kind of a relevance clause. Mm-hmm. Adjust. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think that's So far it's just a general statement of interest, what we intend to do. What we actually get to do we'll see later when we have the stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Two weeks ahead of End of March. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I will be away probably until Easter. So this actually means we have the week directly after Easter between my coming back and you leaving to get the stuff done. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. In my experience what you usually should have is some kind of um, what's it, over-head thingo um beamer. In some cases we might if it's really tough, we might be in need of a of some sound system to play recordings. Should be there, yeah. Adjusting. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Nah. No way anymore. Mm neither do I. Mm-hmm. I could create us another calendar. For the title deadline? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Uh f I think if they're really serious to be a bit late with the title might not be bad, because it will help them to Yeah. Yep. Yep. Getting access to the uh to the account. Blah blah blah blah. Yeah. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. We've got it all written down. Should I take care of the web page? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. No. Not quite, but almost. Yeah. Um Mm-hmm. I think latest s soon as the call is out. Because then we have the call thing, we have that away and look at the boar organisatorial stuff like uh Do we know about chairs, tea, and stuff? Okay.
