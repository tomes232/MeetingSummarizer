Yeah, at least on paper. Yeah. Yeah, at least you can write on the p Yeah, CELP. Yeah. Hmm. No, but Marius is it's similar stuff. No, Marius is also using like Hilbert transform and then Both. Yeah.. Uh is some kind of D_C_T_ or again yeah. Yeah, ok Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. How c Mm-hmm. Yeah. Because use linear phase or Yeah uh Oh okay. Yeah. Yeah. Same frequency. Yeah. For L_S_F_. Main bit rate. What is Good. Oh. Ah, okay. Hmm. Hmm. S Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Hmm. Oh yeah, type. Hmm. S Hmm. S so Oh okay. Smoothed? Or like apply more Hmm. Ah. Hmm. So after you're doing L_S_F_s so or like I mean how you're finally hand coding Ah. Oh. Yeah. So first you apply these triangle filters and then do L_P_C_ coding or like Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Filters. Yeah. Oh okay. Hmm. You can do the L_P_ analysis on each sub-band, yeah. Yeah, m yeah, ok Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So how many L_S_F_s you're using and Oh okay. So but you how many bands you're using? If you're you're not skipping any bands or like oh ok fifteen into twenty then. Like uh. Hmm. Ah. Oh yeah. But phase you're not encoding anything. Phase you're directly transmitting that. Uh no th Yeah, yeah, yeah. The phase of Hilbert envelope. You're not transmitting at all like. Yeah yeah, is noise. Fourier. Yeah. Yeah. So what is the CELP standard now? Like it's it's two kilo-bits per second? Or the Oh that two two kilo-bits per t Ah ok Ah. Some Yeah, yeah. But Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. But this is codec centred, no. You have code book. So Oh it's not codecs code book. There is not code book. Oh ok Oh. Yeah, CELP is Yeah, it's it's it's around one kilo-byte like. Yeah. Yeah, that's a, I think, even G_S_M_ and all this, G_ seven two nine. Yeah, yeah. On based on CELP. At least it gives But still they use a code book, no. So that's really uh it's maybe better than like using just random noise or Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. Yeah. Ah, okay. Hmm. But Hmm.. Inverse, yeah. Inverse Hilbert. Yeah. Yeah. Or output signal like Yeah. And then yeah. Yeah yeah. Hmm. Oh ok Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. But yeah but it's more towards industry, no. Like the yeah, because I worked in a industry for like a small time. But they're they used to implement all these coders, G_S_M_ and I_T_U_ standards. No, just before my P_H_D_. for like few months. Yeah, but that's uh like industry it's really a big deal like. So they they they work on a lot of these standards. Yeah. But mostly they're all based on CELP like mainly. Yeah. So How? Tri-band is G_S_M_. C_D_M_A_. No no, but C_D_M_ is there but now slowly they're introducing G_S_M_ also now in U_S_ like. Yeah, G_S_M_ tri-band. Like the frequencies are different, like very uh Ah. Yeah. Now it's really big competition. Yeah. Standard maybe like established. Yeah. So where do you think your thing is useful? In C_D_M_A_ or G_S_M_? I think maybe in C_D_M_A_ it may be m C_D_M_A_ is more like More time domain. The they they are c doing only Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you know really the these long line telephones, they already have delay, no. At least half a second or yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But mobile m And this one is Uh harmonics and the Yeah. And then picking yeah. Yeah. But maybe the bit rate is the problem, no. Like what David was doing. Like it's really uh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, maybe you can just see how many how many harmonics. He was using twenty, I think. Like yeah, maybe you can try to reduce. Yeah. Yeah. And the f And then all this amplitude. Ah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Each again. Some kind of linear yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some function or like a Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. The size of the But you don't do any voice un-voice decision, no? Yeah, the that's even advantage I think for this approach. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. sorta the modelling, it's really another issue like. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then you have to combine all this harmonic model and noise model. So again you may end up some. 'Cause Oh okay. The pe peak uh Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. S Yeah. Yeah. So that's a you have to tune lot of parameters like I am. But anyway, you don't really need hard decisions, no? Like voiced unvoiced. So m maybe it may help you, but it yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. But do you really really need it or like voiced unvoiced? Yeah, but yeah. Yeah. But it's not really you need t you don't need to specify at each point it's voiced or yeah. Huh. Yeah. And then amplitude. But you're telling even frequency's also shifting, no? Like your delay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So then, yeah, then it's not exactly amplitude modulations or it's it's in between maybe. Yeah. S yeah. So yeah. Yeah.. That's what Marius did, no, like. But but he was keeping all the phase information. No, but even the his coded like he just he he didn't do anything, he just transferred it that way. He was aiming for he's not really kind of doing speech coding, but he want to do it on music. So he doesn't really care about the band-widths or he want to have the quality, no, like. Yeah, but even especially the audio series and the that that's what he was telling like. Yeah, at least even ten K_ bit. Twenty kilo-bits also is okay. So but he's uh he's not I think finished with all that thing. He's just transmitting all the phase and then but he's encoding the envelope, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then leaving the phase, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, or Auto-correlation coefficient and Yeah, they again give the phase. Yeah, again give the phase. Yeah. Oh. Hmm. But this phase is different from your carrier, no? Like yeah. Because you're just doing on uh your uh yeah. And also like yeah. And Yeah. Hmm. But even you can use as a can you use that phase directly? Whereas the d yeah, this one is direct But this is phase of your d uh spectrum, no? Like it's not in time domain. So Of your signal. It's not so then it's bit tricky. Like how Okay, but still you get only the the magnitude of your Hilbert envelope. You won't get the No, but you started with Hil Hilbert envelope, no? Like magnitude of Hilbert envelope. Magnitude of uh no, before D_C_T_ your d oh. Yeah. Ah, ok so input to the D_C_T_ is the speech or like your yeah, okay. Just you're starting with Ah. Ah. Ok ok ok Yeah, maybe the then Yeah. Ah okay. Yeah, it's in frequency domain, no. Yeah, definitely it's d But now I think people Yeah. Yeah. So when is your turn? Uh Oh. Oh okay. I mean just before. Oh you.. Low bit rate. Yes. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah, you know, the the Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Uh. No no no, yeah. Yeah. But it's mostly like this is uh s CELP and these thing. No, I was t uh doing some uh like writing some code for testing and these things where I'm making some t standards for that. So so th th there are like li the thing, these standards, how it works is like they give all the pseudo code kind of thing and then they put severe test conditions. So you have to pass those test conditions. Like then j you can say okay, we implemented D_ seventy eight or D_ se Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why it's really even the t standards they give the test signals also. You are t you can't really do it on whatever database you have. So so you are to use the uh uh yeah. Uh it yeah, it's more like uh they define. So I did for some even also. They're also they define all this the speech condition. Everything they define. So you need to follow all those. Yes, this industry is again different like, yeah. Yeah, I think there isn't only se most yeah. Ah. CELP is from uh A_T_ and T_, no? Like A_T_ and yeah, yeah. It the all this L_P_C_ stuff is Yeah. Ah, ok Ah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The Yeah, that's the main thing even. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like I. Voice over I_P_ or yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And again, lot of this stuff like whe even when I was working mostly that company was developing for voice over I_P_. So they're to put all these things on again D_S_P_s. And also it's mostly like how to how many L_P_C_s are yeah, how many co yeah, it's optimation and then it's even Yeah. Again, now now now even they're also becoming yeah. Even the memories are not really yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So even I think uh then you can have whatever band-width is. It's short really. But no, I think uh but still then that's what maybe people are going toward sign sort of modelling, no. Like I was before when the bandwidth conditions were really stringent then they were using all the p L_P_C_ based source filter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if you want you can look at his code and. But only th yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But definitely it's better than co coded speech, no? Different. Yeah, it's really but uh how much you can get the compress these like what you're telling is you can do all these tricks like. Yeah, these yeah. In yeah. Well yeah, I read uh I reviewed one paper like yeah, the that's that's from no. Yeah, maybe you can look at dates from uh you know east of uh east uh yeah, East Anglia. Yeah. Uh this uh e east University of East Anglia, Ben Milner. Yeah. I yeah, it's yeah, I can forward you that. They're doing lot of tricks. They're like they're again training Gaussian mixtures for different frequencies and then but they can they're following the yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No no, the those things are again based on L_P_C_, no? Like mainly like yeah. Whereas like the pitch estimation in in the X_ waves or these things, they're all dynamic programming based on again L_P_C_ analysis. Yeah. And then construct that. Huh. Yeah, again like uh no, the problem is different for everybody. Like these guys, what they're doing for distributor speech recognition mainly, this uh so. Uh yeah, M_F_C_C_s. So No, it's E_T_S_A_ or something. European Standard yeah Hynek really n yeah, even it's h kind of Aurora framework. So yeah. No, but now it's bit. Yeah, now they're And then yeah, M_F_C_ s But even at distant point they're planning to use for j uh standard D_S_M_ or D_S_ it's not? Or Yeah. E_ uh E_T_S_A_I_, yeah. European, yeah, commission. So M yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, i yeah, all these standards are really okay. Yeah. But Yeah. But the quality again problem, no like? No no. The the eu again, European standard, what this give us, they give the M_F_C_C_s and they give the pitch. Then you are to construct the thing. But if have M_F_C_C_s then like again you have to get the high order M_F_C_C_s and then yeah, then you're have to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. But I think again it's different, no? Like these standards again, all these G_S_M_ standards. Maybe they have the compression standards and again coding stand but maybe uh I I read ah yeah. I don't remember anything like yeah, they're doing yeah, combi yeah, the even even G_ even normal G_ seventy nine, normal speech coder. So they have the speech coding standards again. They are these channel coding. So yeah. So it's mm. Yeah, b Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Again, yeah, i So okay? Yep. Th thank you then. Oh.
