I know. Doesn't look great, does it? Uh-uh. Mm. Yeah there is there's index files already. Yeah. Yeah, in the raw text index directory. Yeah, and it uh allows you to map between the different I_D_s. Yeah, I guess. 'Cause we can't show it in the display. Yeah, they've been cut out the ones that don't have any words. Suppose. Huh. No, I guess not. Hmm. That's just 'cause they would have a blank line in it. Seems a bit stupid. But I can fit 'em back in if Yeah. Yeah, it's a cer uh Yeah, my topic segmenter doesn't like blank lines either. Mm. Oh yeah, cool. Yeah another uh sh issue was that Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh yeah. Huh. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. But yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I don't know if we're gon Do you think we're gonna have time? Is it not is it not only two days anyway? Yeah, that'd probably be quite good. Yeah, I've got a basic search working now. It's g it's got a user interface. So yeah. No. Uh I'm still in my directory, but I I can put it in your directory. Yeah yeah, I've I've not been using that. Yeah. Yeah, I've just been taking the the class files from your directory. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. No one yet. Yeah, that That could be good, yeah. Hmm. Uh. Hmm. Yeah, are we gonna have time to make it display like a whole archive of meetings? Or is it just gonna be displaying single meetings and you'll hold up different ones? Hmm. Yeah, the see, at the moment the dialogue I_D_s just they start at zero for each meeting, they don't run um continuously. But you w you'd like them to run continuously. Yeah, I can change that. Yeah, just to change the index files as well. Mm. Do you want me to put a search in soon? No, oh yeah. Yes. Yeah well, we'll work on it, yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Yes, we're gonna talk about the evaluation next week. Yeah, we could do that. Yeah, I think they're on the N_L_S_S_D_ web page. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, probably as long as we need. But yeah, I don't know. Half an hour or some Yeah, half an hour probably. Hmm. Yeah, I think. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, it may be a good idea to do that. Could we guarantee that it'd work? Hmm. Yeah, I've been able to run it without, yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm sure he'll let us uh test it out before we do it. Yeah Dave, see in the programme manager, do you have a a method to like set the current I_D_ so it'll update the display? 'Cause that's what I'm gonna need when I'm uh like getting search results. Hmm. Right. Yeah, well as far as I've got at the moment, I've made a results class that's got like the I_D_ and the stuff. Yeah. Yep. I'm well, I'm working on it. Right. I yeah, and it might not be there. I know, I was thinking that might be a problem. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. W You could you could when it's when you're doing a search, you could just like sort of zoom back out so you got the full text for that segment or that meeting, rather than a summary. 'Cause that's maybe what you'd want if you were a user. You could provide that option. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Alright. Yeah.
